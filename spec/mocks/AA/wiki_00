Anarchism

Anarchism is often defined as a <db id=/Political_philosophy>political philosophy</db> which holds the <db id=/State_(polity)>state</db> to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful. However, others argue that while anti-statism is central, it is inadequate to define anarchism. Therefore, they argue instead that anarchism entails opposing <db id=/Authority>authority</db> or <db id=/Hierarchical_organization>hierarchical organization</db> in the conduct of human relations, including, but not only, the state system. Proponents of anarchism, known as "anarchists", advocate <db id=/Stateless_society>stateless societies</db> based on non-<db id=/Hierarchy>hierarchical</db> <db id=/Free_association_(communism_and_anarchism)>free associations</db>.
As a subtle and anti-dogmatic philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy. Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive. <db id=/Anarchist_schools_of_thought>Anarchist schools of thought</db> can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme <db id=/Individualism>individualism</db> to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of <db id=/Social_anarchism>social</db> and <db id=/Individualist_anarchism>individualist anarchism</db> or similar dual classifications. Anarchism is often considered a radical <db id=/Left-wing>left-wing</db> ideology, and much of <db id=/Anarchist_economics>anarchist economics</db> and <db id=/Anarchist_law>anarchist legal philosophy</db> reflect <db id=/Libertarian_socialism>anti-authoritarian interpretations</db> of <db id=/Anarcho-communism>communism</db>, <db id=/Collectivist_anarchism>collectivism</db>, <db id=/Anarcho-syndicalism>syndicalism</db>, <db id=/Mutualism_(economic_theory)>mutualism</db>, or <db id=/Participatory_economics>participatory economics</db>.
Anarchism as a mass <db id=/Social_movement>social movement</db> has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. The central tendency of anarchism as a social movement has been represented by <db id=/Anarchist_communism>anarcho-communism</db> and <db id=/Anarcho-syndicalism>anarcho-syndicalism</db>, with <db id=/Individualist_anarchism>individualist anarchism</db> being primarily a literary phenomenon which nevertheless did have an impact on the bigger currents and individualists have also participated in large anarchist organizations. Many anarchists <db id=/Non-aggression_principle>oppose all forms of aggression</db>, supporting <db id=/Self-defense>self-defense</db> or <db id=/Non-violence>non-violence</db> (<db id=/Anarcho-pacifism>anarcho-pacifism</db>), while others have supported the use of some <db id=/Coercion>coercive</db> measures, including violent <db id=/Revolution>revolution</db> and <db id=/Propaganda_of_the_deed>propaganda of the deed</db>, on the path to an anarchist society.
Etymology and terminology.
The term "" derives from the <db id=/Ancient_greek>ancient Greek</db> ἄναρχος, "anarchos", meaning "without rulers", + -ισμός ("-ismos", from the <db id=/Suffix_(linguistics)>suffix</db> -ιζειν, "-izein" "-izing"). "Anarchists" was the term adopted by <db id=/Maximilien_de_robespierre>Maximilien de Robespierre</db> to attack those on the left whom he had used for his own ends during the French Revolution but was determined to get rid of, though among these "anarchists" there were few who exhibited the social revolt characteristics of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as <db id=/William_godwin>William Godwin</db> and <db id=/Wilhelm_weitling>Wilhelm Weitling</db>, but they did not use the word "anarchist" or "anarchism" in describing themselves or their beliefs. <db id=/Pierre-joseph_proudhon>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</db> was the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist, making the formal birth of anarchism the mid-nineteenth century. Since the 1890s from France, the term "libertarianism" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. On the other hand, some use "<db id=/Libertarianism>libertarianism</db>" to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as "<db id=/Libertarian_anarchism>libertarian anarchism</db>".
History.
Origins.
The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC, among the works of <db id=/Taoism>Taoist</db> philosopher <db id=/Laozi>Laozi</db>, and in later centuries by <db id=/Zhuangzi>Zhuangzi</db> and Bao Jingyan. Zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist. <db id=/Zhuangzi>Zhuangzi</db> wrote, "A petty thief is put in jail. A great becomes a ruler of a Nation." <db id=/Diogenes_of_sinope>Diogenes of Sinope</db> and the <db id=/Cynicism_(philosophy)>Cynics</db>, their contemporary <db id=/Zeno_of_citium>Zeno of Citium</db>, the founder of <db id=/Stoicism>Stoicism</db>, also introduced similar topics. <db id=/Jesus>Jesus</db> is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the <db id=/Christian_anarchism>Christian anarchist</db> tradition. Georges Lechartier wrote that "The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and ... the first anarchist society was that of the apostles." Such a distinction reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not <db id=/Anarchism_and_religion>anarchism and religion are compatible</db>. This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful <db id=/Idolatry>idolatry</db>.
The French <db id=/Renaissance_humanism>renaissance</db> political philosopher <db id=/Étienne_de_la_boétie>Étienne de La Boétie</db> has been said to write an important anarchist precedent in his most famous work the "Discourse on Voluntary Servitude".
The radical <db id=/Protestant_christianity>Protestant Christian</db> <db id=/Gerrard_winstanley>Gerrard Winstanley</db> and his group the <db id=/Diggers>Diggers</db> are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England. The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642, during the <db id=/English_civil_war>English Civil War</db>, as a <db id=/Pejorative>term of abuse</db>, used by <db id=/Cavalier>Royalists</db> against their <db id=/Roundhead>Roundhead</db> opponents. By the time of the <db id=/French_revolution>French Revolution</db> some, such as the "<db id=/Enragés>Enragés</db>", began to use the term positively, in opposition to <db id=/Jacobin_(politics)>Jacobin</db> centralisation of power, seeing "revolutionary government" as <db id=/Oxymoron>oxymoronic</db>. By the turn of the 19th century, the English word "anarchism" had lost its initial negative connotation.
Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the <db id=/Age_of_enlightenment>Enlightenment</db>, particularly <db id=/Jean-jacques_rousseau>Jean-Jacques Rousseau</db>'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom. There were a variety of anarchist currents during the <db id=/French_revolution>French Revolution</db>, with some revolutionaries using the term ""anarchiste"" in a positive light as early as September 1793. The "<db id=/Enragés>enragés</db>" opposed revolutionary government as a contradiction in terms. Denouncing the <db id=/Jacobin_club>Jacobin</db> dictatorship, <db id=/Jean_varlet>Jean Varlet</db> wrote in 1794 that "government and revolution are incompatible, unless the people wishes to set its constituted authorities in permanent insurrection against itself." During the French Revolution, <db id=/Sylvain_maréchal>Sylvain Maréchal</db>, in his "Manifesto of the Equals" (1796), demanded "the communal enjoyment of the fruits of the earth" and looked forward to the disappearance of "the revolting distinction of rich and poor, of great and small, of masters and valets, of governors and governed." From this climate <db id=/William_godwin>William Godwin</db> developed what many consider the first expression of <db id=/Anarchist_schools_of_thought>modern anarchist thought</db>. Godwin was, according to <db id=/Peter_kropotkin>Peter Kropotkin</db>, "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work", while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early <db id=/Edmund_burke>Edmund Burke</db>. <db id=/Benjamin_tucker>Benjamin Tucker</db> instead credits <db id=/Josiah_warren>Josiah Warren</db>, an American who promoted stateless and <db id=/Voluntary_community>voluntary communities</db> where all goods and services were <db id=/Privatization>private</db>, with being "the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism." The first to describe himself as an anarchist was <db id=/Pierre-joseph_proudhon>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</db>, a French philosopher and politician, which led some to call him the founder of modern anarchist theory.
The anarcho-communist <db id=/Joseph_déjacque>Joseph Déjacque</db> was the first person to describe himself as "<db id=/Libertarian_socialism>libertarian</db>". Unlike <db id=/Proudhon>Proudhon</db>, he argued that, "it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature." and <db id=/Pierre_joseph_proudhon>Pierre Joseph Proudhon</db>.
First International and the Paris Commune.
In Europe, harsh reaction followed the <db id=/Revolutions_of_1848>revolutions of 1848</db>, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt. In 1864 the <db id=/International_workingmen's_association>International Workingmen's Association</db> (sometimes called the "First International") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of <db id=/Pierre-joseph_proudhon>Proudhon</db>, <db id=/Blanquism>Blanquists</db>, <db id=/Philadelphes>Philadelphes</db>, English trade unionists, <db id=/Socialists>socialists</db> and <db id=/Social_democrats>social democrats</db>.
Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organization. <db id=/Karl_marx>Karl Marx</db> became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the <db id=/Mutualism_(economic_theory)>mutualists</db>, opposed Marx's <db id=/State_socialism>state socialism</db>, advocating political <db id=/Abstentionism>abstentionism</db> and small property holdings.
In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the <db id=/League_of_peace_and_freedom>League of Peace and Freedom</db> (LPF), Russian revolutionary <db id=/Mikhail_bakunin>Mikhail Bakunin</db> and his <db id=/Collectivist_anarchism>collectivist anarchist</db> associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF). They allied themselves with the <db id=/Federalist>federalist</db> socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property.
At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as <db id=/Centralism>centralist</db> and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the <db id=/Ruling_class>ruling class</db> they had fought against.
Anarchist historian <db id=/George_woodcock>George Woodcock</db> reports that "The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse - that they had split away from the Fédération Romande - was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers." In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the <db id=/Hague_congress_(1872)>Hague Congress</db>, where Bakunin and <db id=/James_guillaume>James Guillaume</db> were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the <db id=/Anarchist_st._imier_international>St. Imier Congress</db>, adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.
The <db id=/Paris_commune>Paris Commune</db> was a government that briefly ruled <db id=/Paris>Paris</db> from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included George Woodcock manifests that 
Organized labor.
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organization of labor." In 1886, the <db id=/Federation_of_organized_trades_and_labor_unions>Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions</db> (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the <db id=/Eight-hour_day>eight-hour work day</db> would become standard.
In response, unions across the <db id=/United_states>United States</db> prepared a <db id=/General_strike>general strike</db> in support of the event. On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when <db id=/Strikebreaker>strikebreakers</db> attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd. The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square. A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer. In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed. Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the <db id=/Haymarket_affair>Haymarket affair</db>, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair. Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of <db id=/International_workers'_day>International Workers' Day</db> on <db id=/May_day>May Day</db> had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.
In 1907, the <db id=/International_anarchist_congress_of_amsterdam>International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam</db> gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including <db id=/Errico_malatesta>Errico Malatesta</db>, <db id=/Pierre_monatte>Pierre Monatte</db>, <db id=/Luigi_fabbri>Luigi Fabbri</db>, <db id=/Benoît_broutchoux>Benoît Broutchoux</db>, <db id=/Emma_goldman>Emma Goldman</db>, <db id=/Rudolf_rocker>Rudolf Rocker</db>, and <db id=/Christiaan_cornelissen>Christiaan Cornelissen</db>. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, <db id=/Popular_education>popular education</db> issues, the <db id=/General_strike>general strike</db> or <db id=/Antimilitarism>antimilitarism</db>. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and <db id=/Syndicalism>syndicalism</db> (or <db id=/Trade_union>trade unionism</db>). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a <db id=/Social_revolution>social revolution</db>, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. He thought that the trade-union movement was <db id=/Reformism>reformist</db> and even <db id=/Conservatism>conservative</db>, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.
The <db id=/Federación_anarquista_ibérica>Spanish Workers Federation</db> in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the <db id=/Confederación_nacional_del_trabajo>Confederación Nacional del Trabajo</db> (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the <db id=/Spanish_civil_war>Spanish Civil War</db>. The CNT was affiliated with the <db id=/International_workers_association>International Workers Association</db>, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular "The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in <db id=/Anarchism_in_mexico>Mexico</db>, <db id=/Anarchism_in_brazil>Brazil</db>, Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organization was
undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organizations was the <db id=/Federación_obrera_regional_argentina>Federación Obrera Regional Argentina</db> ... it grew quickly
to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions."
Propaganda of the deed and illegalism.
Some anarchists, such as <db id=/Johann_most>Johann Most</db>, advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda." By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, "propaganda of the deed" to refer to individual bombings, <db id=/Regicide>regicides</db>, and <db id=/Tyrannicide>tyrannicides</db>. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal '<db id=/Confiscation>expropriations</db>'." <db id=/Illegalism>Illegalism</db> as a practice emerged and within it "The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("<db id=/Propaganda_by_the_deed>propaganda by the deed</db>") and the anarchist burglars ("<db id=/Individual_reappropriation>individual reappropriation</db>") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be "exemplary" invitations to revolt.". France's <db id=/Bonnot_gang>Bonnot Gang</db> was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.
However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. <db id=/Peter_kropotkin>Peter Kropotkin</db> thus wrote that year in "Le Révolté" that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite". A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favor of collective revolutionary action, for example through the <db id=/Trade_union>trade union</db> movement. The <db id=/Anarcho-syndicalism>anarcho-syndicalist</db>, <db id=/Fernand_pelloutier>Fernand Pelloutier</db>, argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter."
<db id=/Political_repression>State repression</db> (including the infamous 1894 French "<db id=/Lois_scélérates>lois scélérates</db>") of the anarchist and <db id=/Labor_movement>labor movements</db> following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French <db id=/Socialist_movement>socialist movement</db>, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 <db id=/Paris_commune>Paris Commune</db>, the execution and exile of many "<db id=/Communards>communards</db>" to <db id=/Penal_colonies>penal colonies</db>, favored individualist political expression and acts.
Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement. For example, U.S. <db id=/William_mckinley>President McKinley</db>'s assassin <db id=/Leon_czolgosz>Leon Czolgosz</db> claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and <db id=/Feminist>feminist</db> <db id=/Emma_goldman>Emma Goldman</db>. Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because <db id=/International_terrorism>international terrorism</db> arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite. This image remains to this day.
Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after <db id=/World_war_i>World War I</db> (1914–1918) and the <db id=/1917_october_revolution>1917 October Revolution</db>.
Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s.
Anarchists participated alongside the <db id=/Bolshevik>Bolsheviks</db> in both <db id=/February_revolution>February</db> and <db id=/October_revolution>October revolutions</db>, and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution. However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 <db id=/Kronstadt_rebellion>Kronstadt rebellion</db>, which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the <db id=/Ukraine>Ukraine</db>. There, in the <db id=/Free_territory_(ukraine)>Free Territory</db>, they fought in the <db id=/Russian_civil_war>civil war</db> against the <db id=/White_movement>Whites</db> (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the <db id=/Revolutionary_insurrectionary_army_of_ukraine>Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine</db> led by <db id=/Nestor_makhno>Nestor Makhno</db>, who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.
Expelled American anarchists <db id=/Emma_goldman>Emma Goldman</db> and <db id=/Alexander_berkman>Alexander Berkman</db> were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the <db id=/Kronstadt_rebellion>Kronstadt uprising</db>, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticizing the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, <db id=/Mikhail_bakunin>Bakunin</db>'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new "socialist" Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.
The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; <db id=/Communist_party>Communist parties</db> grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the <db id=/Confédération_générale_du_travail>CGT</db> and <db id=/Industrial_workers_of_the_world>IWW</db> left the organizations and joined the <db id=/Comintern>Communist International</db>.
The <db id=/Revolutions_of_1917–23>revolutionary wave of 1917–23</db> saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism. In the German uprising known as the <db id=/German_revolution_of_1918–1919>German Revolution of 1918–1919</db> which established the <db id=/Bavarian_soviet_republic>Bavarian Soviet Republic</db> the anarchists <db id=/Gustav_landauer>Gustav Landauer</db>, <db id=/Silvio_gesell>Silvio Gesell</db> and <db id=/Erich_mühsam>Erich Mühsam</db> had important leadership positions within the revolutionary <db id=/Council_communism>councilist</db> structures. In the Italian events known as the "<db id=/Biennio_rosso>biennio rosso</db>" the anarcho-syndicalist trade union <db id=/Unione_sindacale_italiana>Unione Sindacale Italiana</db> "grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union (20,000 members plus "<db id=/Umanita_nova>Umanita Nova</db>", its daily paper) grew accordingly ... Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces. In the <db id=/Mexican_revolution>Mexican Revolution</db> the <db id=/Mexican_liberal_party>Mexican Liberal Party</db> was established and during the early 1910s it lead a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in <db id=/Baja_california>Baja California</db> with the leadership of anarcho-communist <db id=/Ricardo_flores_magón>Ricardo Flores Magón</db>.
In Paris, the <db id=/Dielo_truda>Dielo Truda</db> group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included <db id=/Nestor_makhno>Nestor Makhno</db>, concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the "<db id=/Organizational_platform_of_the_general_union_of_anarchists_(draft)>Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)</db>", was supported. <db id=/Platformist>Platformist</db> groups active today include the <db id=/Workers_solidarity_movement>Workers Solidarity Movement</db> in Ireland and the <db id=/Nefac>North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists</db> of North America. <db id=/Synthesis_anarchism>Synthesis anarchism</db> emerged as an organizational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of <db id=/Anarchism_without_adjectives>anarchism without adjectives</db>. In the 1920s this form found as its main proponents <db id=/Volin>Volin</db> and <db id=/Sebastien_faure>Sebastien Faure</db>. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global <db id=/International_of_anarchist_federations>International of Anarchist Federations</db>.
Conflicts with European fascist regimes.
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of <db id=/Fascism>fascism</db> in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. <db id=/Anarchism_in_italy>Italian anarchists</db> played a key role in the <db id=/Anti-fascism>anti-fascist</db> organisation "<db id=/Arditi_del_popolo>Arditi del Popolo</db>", which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling <db id=/Blackshirts>Blackshirts</db> in the anarchist stronghold of <db id=/Parma>Parma</db> in August 1922. The veteran Italian anarchist, <db id=/Luigi_fabbri>Luigi Fabbri</db>, was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as "the preventive counter-revolution." In France, where the <db id=/Far_right_leagues>far right leagues</db> came close to insurrection in the <db id=/6_february_1934_crisis>February 1934 riots</db>, anarchists divided over a <db id=/United_front>united front</db> policy.
Anarchists in <db id=/Anarchism_in_france>France</db> and <db id=/Anarchism_in_italy>Italy</db> were active in the <db id=/Resistance_during_world_war_ii>Resistance during World War II</db>. In Germany the anarchist <db id=/Erich_mühsam>Erich Mühsam</db> was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the <db id=/Reichstag_fire>Reichstag fire</db> in Berlin. <db id=/Joseph_goebbels>Joseph Goebbels</db>, the Nazi <db id=/Propagandaministerium>propaganda minister</db>, labelled him as one of "those Jewish subversives." Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at <db id=/Sonnenburg>Sonnenburg</db>, <db id=/Brandenburg>Brandenburg</db> and finally, <db id=/Oranienburg>Oranienburg</db>. On 2 February 1934, Mühsam was transferred to the <db id=/Nazi_concentration_camps>concentration camp</db> at <db id=/Oranienburg_concentration_camp>Oranienburg</db> when finally on the night of 9 July 1934, Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.
Spanish Revolution.
In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union <db id=/Confederación_nacional_del_trabajo>Confederación Nacional del Trabajo</db> initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the <db id=/Spanish_civil_war>Spanish Civil War</db> (1936–1939). In response to the army rebellion, an <db id=/Anarchism_in_spain>anarchist-inspired</db> movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of <db id=/Barcelona>Barcelona</db> and of large areas of rural Spain where they <db id=/Collective_farming>collectivised</db> the land. But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the <db id=/Stalinism>Stalinists</db>, who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the <db id=/Soviet_union>Soviet Union</db>. The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' <db id=/Social_revolution>social revolution</db> that began during the outbreak of the <db id=/Spanish_civil_war>Spanish Civil War</db> in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of <db id=/Anarchism_in_spain>anarchist</db> and more broadly <db id=/Libertarian_socialist>libertarian socialist</db> organizational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily <db id=/Catalonia>Catalonia</db>, <db id=/Aragon>Aragon</db>, <db id=/Andalusia>Andalusia</db>, and parts of <db id=/Levante,_spain>the Levante</db>. Much of <db id=/Spain's_economy>Spain's economy</db> was put under worker control; in <db id=/Anarchist>anarchist</db> strongholds like <db id=/Catalonia>Catalonia</db>, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy <db id=/Communist_party_of_spain_(main)>Communist Party of Spain</db> influence, as the <db id=/Soviet_union>Soviet</db>-allied party actively resisted attempts at <db id=/Collectivization>collectivization</db> enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, <db id=/Agriculture>agrarian</db> areas became collectivised and run as <db id=/Libertarian_socialism>libertarian</db> <db id=/Commune_(intentional_community)>communes</db>. Anarchist historian <db id=/Sam_dolgoff>Sam Dolgoff</db> estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history."
<db id=/Stalinist_purges>Stalinist</db>-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both <db id=/Workers'_party_of_marxist_unification>dissident Marxists</db> and anarchists. The prominent Italian anarchist <db id=/Camillo_berneri>Camillo Berneri</db>, who volunteered to fight against Franco was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the <db id=/Spanish_communist_party>Spanish Communist Party</db>.
Post-war years.
Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time, such as <db id=/Albert_camus>Albert Camus</db>, <db id=/Herbert_read>Herbert Read</db>, <db id=/Paul_goodman_(writer)>Paul Goodman</db>, <db id=/Dwight_macdonald>Dwight Macdonald</db>, <db id=/Allen_ginsberg>Allen Ginsberg</db>, <db id=/George_woodcock>George Woodcock</db>, <db id=/Julian_beck>Julian Beck</db>—and the French <db id=/Surrealism>Surrealist</db> group led by <db id=/André_breton>André Breton</db>, which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the <db id=/Fédération_anarchiste>Fédération Anarchiste</db>.
<db id=/Anarcho-pacifism>Anarcho-pacifism</db> became influential in the <db id=/Anti-nuclear_movement>Anti-nuclear movement</db> and <db id=/Anti_war_movement>anti war movements</db> of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of <db id=/Campaign_for_nuclear_disarmament>Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</db> <db id=/Alex_comfort>Alex Comfort</db> or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists <db id=/Ammon_hennacy>Ammon Hennacy</db> and <db id=/Dorothy_day>Dorothy Day</db>. Anarcho-pacifism became a "basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the <db id=/Cold_war>Cold War</db>." The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham's , "Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977)".
Contemporary anarchism.
In the United Kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the <db id=/Punk_rock>punk rock</db> movement, as exemplified by bands such as <db id=/Crass>Crass</db> and the <db id=/Sex_pistols>Sex Pistols</db>. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of <db id=/Commune_(intentional_community)>communes</db> and <db id=/Squatting>squatter</db> movements like that of <db id=/Barcelona>Barcelona</db>, Spain. In Denmark, <db id=/Squatter>squatters</db> occupied a disused military base and declared the <db id=/Freetown_christiania>Freetown Christiania</db>, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen.
Since the revival of anarchism in the mid 20th century, a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of <db id=/Anarcha-feminism>anarcha-feminism</db>, they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. The <db id=/American_civil_rights_movement>American Civil Rights Movement</db> and the movement against the <db id=/Vietnam_war>war in Vietnam</db> also contributed to the revival of North American anarchism. European anarchism of the late 20th century drew much of its strength from the labour movement, and both have incorporated <db id=/Animal_rights>animal rights</db> activism. Anarchist anthropologist <db id=/David_graeber>David Graeber</db> and anarchist historian <db id=/Andrej_grubacic>Andrej Grubacic</db> have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those "who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits" of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are "much more informed, among other elements, by <db id=/Traditional_knowledge>indigenous</db>, <db id=/Feminism>feminist</db>, <db id=/Ecology>ecological</db> and <db id=/Counterculture>cultural-critical</db> ideas", and who by the turn of the 21st century formed "by far the majority" of anarchists.
Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and <db id=/Anti-globalisation_movement>anti-globalisation movements</db>. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the <db id=/World_trade_organization>World Trade Organization</db> (WTO), <db id=/G8>Group of Eight</db>, and the <db id=/World_economic_forum>World Economic Forum</db>. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as "<db id=/Black_bloc>black blocs</db>"; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include <db id=/Security_culture>security culture</db>, <db id=/Affinity_groups>affinity groups</db> and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at <db id=/World_trade_organization_ministerial_conference_of_1999_protest_activity>WTO conference in Seattle in 1999</db>. According to anarchist scholar <db id=/Simon_critchley>Simon Critchley</db>, "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary <db id=/Neo-liberalism>neo-liberalism</db> ... One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally."
International anarchist federations in existence include the <db id=/International_of_anarchist_federations>International of Anarchist Federations</db>, the <db id=/International_workers'_association>International Workers' Association</db>, and <db id=/International_libertarian_solidarity>International Libertarian Solidarity</db>.
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the <db id=/Confederación_general_del_trabajo>Confederación General del Trabajo</db> (CGT) and the <db id=/Confederación_nacional_del_trabajo>CNT</db>. CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003. Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the <db id=/Central_organisation_of_the_workers_of_sweden>Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden</db> and the <db id=/Swedish_anarcho-syndicalist_youth_federation>Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation</db>; the CNT-AIT in France; the <db id=/Unione_sindacale_italiana>Union Sindicale Italiana</db> in Italy; in the US <db id=/Workers_solidarity_alliance>Workers Solidarity Alliance</db> and the UK <db id=/Solidarity_federation>Solidarity Federation</db>. The revolutionary industrial unionist <db id=/Industrial_workers_of_the_world>Industrial Workers of the World</db>, claiming 2,000 paying members, and the <db id=/International_workers_association>International Workers Association</db>, an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.
Anarchist schools of thought.
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, <db id=/Individualist_anarchism>individualist anarchism</db> and <db id=/Social_anarchism>social anarchism</db>, which have some different origins, values and evolution. The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises <db id=/Negative_liberty>negative liberty</db>, i.e. opposition to state or <db id=/Social_control>social control</db> over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise <db id=/Positive_liberty>positive liberty</db> to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill, "recognizing equality of entitlement". In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical — those created throughout the 19th century — and post-classical anarchist schools — those created since the mid-20th century and after.
Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is <db id=/Philosophical_anarchism>philosophical anarchism</db>, which embodies the theoretical stance that the <db id=/State_(polity)>state</db> lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a <db id=/Minarchism>minimal state</db> as unfortunate, and usually temporary, "necessary evil" but argue that citizens do not have a <db id=/Moral_obligation>moral obligation</db> to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy. One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was "<db id=/Anarchism_without_adjectives>anarchism without adjectives</db>", a call for <db id=/Toleration>toleration</db> first adopted by <db id=/Fernando_tarrida_del_mármol>Fernando Tarrida del Mármol</db> in 1889 in response to the "bitter debates" of anarchist theory at the time. In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist- and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the <db id=/Anti-authoritarian>anti-authoritarian</db> beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.
Classical anarchist schools of thought.
Mutualism.
Mutualism began in 18th century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with <db id=/Pierre-joseph_proudhon>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</db> in France and others in the United States. Proudhon proposed <db id=/Spontaneous_order>spontaneous order</db>, whereby organization emerges without central authority, a "positive anarchy" where order arises when everybody does "what he wishes and only what he wishes" and where "business transactions alone produce the social order." It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service.
Mutualist anarchism is concerned with <db id=/Reciprocity_(cultural_anthropology)>reciprocity</db>, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist <db id=/William_batchelder_greene>William Batchelder Greene</db>, each worker in the mutualist system would receive "just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount." Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism."Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought", Blackwell Publishing 1991 ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p. 11.</ref> Proudhon first characterised his goal as a "third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property."
Individualist anarchism.
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the <db id=/Individual>individual</db> and their <db id=/Will_(philosophy)>will</db> over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems. Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.
In 1793, <db id=/William_godwin>William Godwin</db>, who has often been cited as the first anarchist, wrote "<db id=/Political_justice>Political Justice</db>", which some consider the first expression of anarchism. Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a <db id=/Rationalist>rationalist</db> and <db id=/Utilitarian>utilitarian</db> basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a <db id=/Limited_government>minimal state</db> as a present "necessary evil" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. Godwin advocated <db id=/Individualism>individualism</db>, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.
An influential form of individualist anarchism, called "egoism," or <db id=/Egoist_anarchism>egoist anarchism</db>, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German <db id=/Max_stirner>Max Stirner</db>. Stirner's "<db id=/The_ego_and_its_own>The Ego and Its Own</db>", published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy. According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire, without regard for God, state, or morality. To Stirner, rights were "<db id=/Reification_(fallacy)>spooks</db>" in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but "the individuals are its reality". Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw <db id=/Union_of_egoists>unions of egoists</db>, non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will, which Stirner proposed as a form of organization in place of the <db id=/State_(polity)>state</db>. Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals. "Egoism" has inspired many interpretations of Stirner's philosophy. It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and <db id=/Lgbt>LGBT</db> activist <db id=/John_henry_mackay>John Henry Mackay</db>.
<db id=/Josiah_warren>Josiah Warren</db> is widely regarded as the first American <db id=/Anarchist>anarchist</db>, and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, "The Peaceful Revolutionist", was the first anarchist periodical published. For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster "It is apparent ... that <db id=/Proudhon>Proudhonian</db> Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of <db id=/Josiah_warren>Josiah Warren</db> and <db id=/Stephen_pearl_andrews>Stephen Pearl Andrews</db> ... <db id=/William_b._greene>William B. Greene</db> presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form.". <db id=/Henry_david_thoreau>Henry David Thoreau</db> (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, <db id=/Development_criticism>development critic</db>, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading <db id=/Transcendentalist>transcendentalist</db>. He is best known for his books "<db id=/Walden>Walden</db>", a reflection upon <db id=/Simple_living>simple living</db> in natural surroundings, and his essay, "<db id=/Civil_disobedience_(thoreau)>Civil Disobedience</db>", an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later <db id=/Benjamin_tucker>Benjamin Tucker</db> fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication "<db id=/Liberty_(1881–1908)>Liberty</db>".
From these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals, <db id=/Free_love>free love</db> and <db id=/Birth_control>birth control</db> advocates (see <db id=/Anarchism_and_issues_related_to_love_and_sex>Anarchism and issues related to love and sex</db>), individualist <db id=/Naturism>naturists</db> <db id=/Nudism>nudists</db> (see <db id=/Anarcho-naturism>anarcho-naturism</db>), <db id=/Freethought>freethought</db> and <db id=/Anti-clericalism>anti-clearical</db> activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as <db id=/Illegalism>illegalism</db> and <db id=/Individual_reclamation>individual reclamation</db> (see <db id=/European_individualist_anarchism>European individualist anarchism</db> and <db id=/Individualist_anarchism_in_france>individualist anarchism in France</db>). These authors and activists included <db id=/Oscar_wilde>Oscar Wilde</db>, <db id=/Emile_armand>Emile Armand</db>, <db id=/Han_ryner>Han Ryner</db>, <db id=/Henri_zisly>Henri Zisly</db>, <db id=/Renzo_novatore>Renzo Novatore</db>, <db id=/Miguel_gimenez_igualada>Miguel Gimenez Igualada</db>, <db id=/Adolf_brand>Adolf Brand</db> and <db id=/Lev_chernyi>Lev Chernyi</db> among others.
Social anarchism.
Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without any government authority or <db id=/Coercion>coercion</db>. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism. Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for <db id=/Personal_property>personal property</db>), and emphasises cooperation and <db id=/Mutual_aid_(organization)>mutual aid</db>.
Collectivist anarchism.
Collectivist anarchism, also referred to as "revolutionary socialism" or a form of such, is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with <db id=/Mikhail_bakunin>Mikhail Bakunin</db> and <db id=/Johann_most>Johann Most</db>. Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or "<db id=/Propaganda_by_the_deed>propaganda by the deed</db>", which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.
However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by <db id=/Anarchist_communists>anarchist communists</db> as effectively "uphold the wages system". Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with <db id=/Marxism>Marxism</db> but opposed the Marxist <db id=/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat>dictatorship of the proletariat</db>, despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society. Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not <db id=/Mutually_exclusive>mutually exclusive</db>; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.
Anarcho-communism.
Anarchist communism (also known as anarcho-communism, libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the <db id=/State_(polity)>state</db>, <db id=/Markets>markets</db>, <db id=/Money>money</db>, <db id=/Private_property>private property</db> (while retaining respect for <db id=/Personal_property>personal property</db>), and <db id=/Capitalism>capitalism</db> in favor of <db id=/Common_ownership>common ownership</db> of the <db id=/Means_of_production>means of production</db>, <db id=/Direct_democracy>direct democracy</db> and a horizontal network of <db id=/Voluntary_association>voluntary associations</db> and <db id=/Workers'_council>workers' councils</db> with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "<db id=/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_need>from each according to his ability, to each according to his need</db>".
Some forms of anarchist communism such as <db id=/Insurrectionary_anarchism>insurrectionary anarchism</db> are strongly influenced by <db id=/Egoist_anarchism>egoism</db> and radical <db id=/Individualism>individualism</db>, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom. Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.
Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the <db id=/First_international>First International</db>. The theoretical work of <db id=/Peter_kropotkin>Peter Kropotkin</db> took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organizationalist and <db id=/Insurrectionary_anarchism>insurrectionary anti-organizationalist</db> sections. To date, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e., established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the <db id=/Spanish_revolution>Spanish Revolution</db> and the <db id=/Free_territory>Free Territory</db> during the <db id=/Russian_revolution_(1917)>Russian Revolution</db>. Through the efforts and influence of the <db id=/Spanish_anarchists>Spanish Anarchists</db> during the <db id=/Spanish_revolution>Spanish Revolution</db> within the <db id=/Spanish_civil_war>Spanish Civil War</db>, starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, as well as in the stronghold of <db id=/Anarchist_catalonia>Anarchist Catalonia</db> before being crushed by the combined forces of <db id=/Francoism>the regime that won the war</db>, <db id=/Adolf_hitler>Hitler</db>, Mussolini, Spanish Communist Party repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself. During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as <db id=/Nestor_makhno>Nestor Makhno</db> worked to create and defend—through the <db id=/Revolutionary_insurrectionary_army_of_ukraine>Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine</db>—anarchist communism in the <db id=/Free_territory>Free Territory</db> of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.
Anarcho-syndicalism.
Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the <db id=/Labor_union>labor movement</db>. Anarcho-syndicalists view <db id=/Trade_union>labor unions</db> as a potential force for <db id=/Revolution>revolutionary</db> social change, replacing capitalism and the <db id=/State_(polity)>state</db> with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers' , <db id=/Direct_action>Direct action</db> and <db id=/Workers'_self-management>Workers' self-management</db>
Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only <db id=/Direct_action>direct action</db>—that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position—will allow workers to liberate themselves. Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. <db id=/Rudolf_rocker>Rudolf Rocker</db> was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet "Anarcho-Syndicalism".The <db id=/International_workers_association>International Workers Association</db> is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries. The Spanish <db id=/Confederación_nacional_del_trabajo>Confederación Nacional del Trabajo</db> played and still plays a major role in the Spanish <db id=/Labor_movement>labor movement</db>. It was also an important force in the <db id=/Spanish_civil_war>Spanish Civil War</db>.
Post-classical schools of thought.
Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and <db id=/Syncretic_politics>syncretic</db>, combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.
<db id=/Anarcha-feminism>Anarcha-feminism</db> developed as a synthesis of <db id=/Radical_feminism>radical feminism</db> and anarchism that views <db id=/Patriarchy>patriarchy</db> (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government. It was inspired by the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as <db id=/Lucy_parsons>Lucy Parsons</db>, <db id=/Emma_goldman>Emma Goldman</db>, and <db id=/Voltairine_de_cleyre>Voltairine de Cleyre</db>. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education, and <db id=/Gender_role>gender roles</db>.
<db id=/Green_anarchism>Green anarchism</db> (or eco-anarchism) is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasizes environmental issues, with an important precedent in <db id=/Anarcho-naturism>anarcho-naturism</db>, and whose main contemporary currents are <db id=/Anarcho-primitivism>anarcho-primitivism</db> and <db id=/Social_ecology>social ecology</db>.
<db id=/Anarcho-pacifism>Anarcho-pacifism</db> is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change (see <db id=/Non-violence>non-violence</db>). It developed "mostly in the <db id=/Netherlands>Netherlands</db>, <db id=/United_kingdom>Britain</db>, and the <db id=/United_states>United States</db>, before and during the <db id=/World_war_ii>Second World War</db>". <db id=/Christian_anarchism>Christian anarchism</db> is a <db id=/Christian_movement>movement</db> in <db id=/Political_theology>political theology</db> that combines anarchism and <db id=/Christianity>Christianity</db>. Its main proponents included <db id=/Leo_tolstoy>Leo Tolstoy</db>, <db id=/Dorothy_day>Dorothy Day</db>, <db id=/Ammon_hennacy>Ammon Hennacy</db>, and <db id=/Jacques_ellul>Jacques Ellul</db>.
<db id=/Platformism>Platformism</db> is a tendency within the wider <db id=/Anarchist>anarchist</db> movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of <db id=/Dielo_truda>Dielo Truda</db>'s "Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)". The document was based on the experiences of <db id=/Anarchism_in_russia>Russian anarchists</db> in the 1917 <db id=/October_revolution>October Revolution</db>, which led eventually to the victory of the <db id=/Bolsheviks>Bolsheviks</db> over the anarchists and other groups. The "Platform" attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the <db id=/Russian_revolution_(1917)>Russian Revolution</db>.
<db id=/Synthesis_anarchism>Synthesis anarchism</db> is a form of <db id=/Anarchist>anarchist</db> organization that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of <db id=/Anarchism_without_adjectives>anarchism without adjectives</db>. In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents the <db id=/Anarcho-communists>anarcho-communists</db> <db id=/Voline>Voline</db> and <db id=/Sébastien_faure>Sébastien Faure</db>. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global <db id=/International_of_anarchist_federations>International of Anarchist Federations</db>.
<db id=/Post-left_anarchy>Post-left anarchy</db> is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional <db id=/Left-wing_politics>Left-wing politics</db>. Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of <db id=/Ideology>ideology</db> in general also presenting a critique of <db id=/Organizations>organizations</db> and <db id=/Morality>morality</db>. Influenced by the work of <db id=/Max_stirner>Max Stirner</db> and by the Marxist <db id=/Situationist_international>Situationist International</db>, post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on <db id=/Social>social</db> <db id=/Insurrectionary_anarchism>insurrection</db> and a rejection of leftist social organisation.
<db id=/Insurrectionary_anarchism>Insurrectionary anarchism</db> is a revolutionary theory, practice, and tendency within the <db id=/Anarchist>anarchist</db> movement which emphasizes <db id=/Insurrection>insurrection</db> within anarchist practice. It is critical of formal organizations such as <db id=/Labor_unions>labor unions</db> and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization and small <db id=/Affinity_group>affinity group</db> based organization. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent <db id=/Class_conflict>class conflict</db>, and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.
<db id=/Post-anarchism>Post-anarchism</db> is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and <db id=/Poststructuralist>poststructuralist</db> thought, drawing from diverse ideas including <db id=/Post-modernism>post-modernism</db>, <db id=/Autonomist_marxism>autonomist marxism</db>, <db id=/Post-left_anarchy>post-left anarchy</db>, <db id=/Situationist_international>situationism</db>, and <db id=/Postcolonialism>postcolonialism</db>.
<db id=/Anarcho-capitalism>Anarcho-capitalism</db> advocates the elimination of the <db id=/State_(polity)>state</db> in favor of <db id=/Sovereign_individual>individual sovereignty</db> in a <db id=/Free_market>free market</db>. Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state <db id=/Libertarianism>libertarianism</db> and <db id=/Individualist_anarchism>individualist anarchism</db>, There is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an <db id=/Anti-capitalist>anti-capitalist</db> movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms.
Internal issues and debates.
Anarchism is a <db id=/Philosophy>philosophy</db> that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of <db id=/Anarchism_and_capitalism>capitalism</db>, <db id=/Anarchism_and_nationalism>nationalism</db>, and <db id=/Anarchism_and_religion>religion</db> with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as <db id=/Anarchism_and_marxism>Marxism</db>, <db id=/Issues_in_anarchism#communism>communism</db> and <db id=/Anarchism_and_capitalism>capitalism</db>. Anarchists may be motivated by <db id=/Humanism>humanism</db>, <db id=/Christian_anarchism>divine authority</db>, <db id=/Ethical_egoism>enlightened self-interest</db>, <db id=/Veganarchism>veganism</db> or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.
Phenomena such as <db id=/Civilization>civilization</db>, <db id=/Technology>technology</db> (e.g. within <db id=/Anarcho-primitivism>anarcho-primitivism</db> and <db id=/Insurrectionary_anarchism>insurrectionary anarchism</db>), and <db id=/Issues_in_anarchism#participation_in_statist_democracy>the democratic process</db> may be sharply criticized within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.
On a tactical level, while <db id=/Propaganda_of_the_deed>propaganda of the deed</db> was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the <db id=/Nihilist_movement>Nihilist movement</db>), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative <db id=/Direct_action>direct action</db> methods such as <db id=/Nonviolence>nonviolence</db>, <db id=/Counter-economics>counter-economics</db> and <db id=/Crypto-anarchism>anti-state cryptography</db> to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones. The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many <db id=/Definitional_concerns_in_anarchist_theory>definitional concerns in anarchist theory</db>.
Topics of interest.
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.
Free love.
An important current within anarchism is <db id=/Free_love>free love</db>. Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to <db id=/Josiah_warren>Josiah Warren</db> and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership. Free love particularly stressed <db id=/Women's_rights>women's rights</db> since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures. The most important American free love journal was "<db id=/Lucifer_the_lightbearer>Lucifer the Lightbearer</db>" (1883–1907) edited by <db id=/Moses_harman>Moses Harman</db> and <db id=/Lois_waisbrooker>Lois Waisbrooker</db>, but also there existed <db id=/Ezra_heywood>Ezra Heywood</db> and Angela Heywood's "<db id=/The_word_(free_love)>"The Word"</db>" (1872–1890, 1892–1893). "<db id=/Free_society>Free Society</db>" (1895–1897 as "The Firebrand"; 1897–1904 as "Free Society") was a major anarchist newspaper in the <db id=/United_states>United States</db> at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. The publication advocated <db id=/Free_love>free love</db> and <db id=/Women's_rights>women's rights</db>, and critiqued "<db id=/Comstockery>Comstockery</db>"—censorship of sexual information. Also <db id=/M._e._lazarus>M. E. Lazarus</db> was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.
In New York City's <db id=/Greenwich_village>Greenwich Village</db>, <db id=/Bohemianism>bohemian</db> feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now. They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality, and the openly bisexual radical <db id=/Edna_st._vincent_millay>Edna St. Vincent Millay</db> and the lesbian anarchist <db id=/Margaret_anderson>Margaret Anderson</db> were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by <db id=/Emma_goldman>Emma Goldman</db>, among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman "has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public." In fact, before Goldman, <db id=/Heterosexual>heterosexual</db> anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal "Der arme Teufel". In Argentina anarcha-feminist <db id=/Virginia_bolten>Virginia Bolten</db> published the newspaper called "" (), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.
In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was <db id=/Emile_armand>Emile Armand</db>. He proposed the concept of "la camaraderie amoureuse" to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of <db id=/Polyamory>polyamory</db>. In Germany the <db id=/Stirner>stirnerists</db> <db id=/Adolf_brand>Adolf Brand</db> and <db id=/John_henry_mackay>John Henry Mackay</db> were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male <db id=/Bisexuality>bisexuality</db> and <db id=/Homosexuality>homosexuality</db>.
More recently, the British <db id=/Anarcho-pacifist>anarcho-pacifist</db> <db id=/Alex_comfort>Alex Comfort</db> gained notoriety during the <db id=/Sexual_revolution>sexual revolution</db> for writing the bestseller sex manual "<db id=/The_joy_of_sex>The Joy of Sex</db>". The issue of <db id=/Free_love>free love</db> has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-<db id=/Hedonist>hedonist</db> philosopher <db id=/Michel_onfray>Michel Onfray</db> in such works as "Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire" (2000) and "L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques" (2002).
Libertarian education and freethought.
In the United States "freethought was a basically <db id=/Anti-christianity>anti-christian</db>, <db id=/Anti-clerical>anti-clerical</db> movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to "<db id=/Liberty_(1881–1908)>Liberty</db>" (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of "Freethought" and, for a time, "The Truth Seeker". E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal "<db id=/Lucifer,_the_light-bearer>Lucifer, the Light-Bearer</db>"". "Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as "<db id=/Lucifer,_the_light-bearer>Lucifer, the Light-Bearer</db>", "Freethought" and "The Truth Seeker" appeared in "<db id=/Liberty_(1881–1908)>Liberty</db>"... The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself".
In 1901, Catalan anarchist and <db id=/Freethought>free-thinker</db> <db id=/Francesc_ferrer_i_guàrdia>Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia</db> established "modern" or <db id=/Progressive_education>progressive schools</db> in <db id=/Barcelona>Barcelona</db> in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church. The schools' stated goal was to "<db id=/Popular_education>educate the working class</db> in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state. <db id=/Murray_bookchin>Murray Bookchin</db> wrote: "This period was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally." La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of "<db id=/Modern_school_(united_states)>Modern Schools</db>" in the <db id=/United_states>United States</db>, <db id=/Cuba>Cuba</db>, <db id=/South_america>South America</db> and <db id=/London>London</db>. The first of these was started in <db id=/New_york_city>New York City</db> in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper "<db id=/Università_popolare_(italian_newspaper)>Università popolare</db>", founded in 1901. Russian <db id=/Christian_anarchist>christian anarchist</db> <db id=/Leo_tolstoy>Leo Tolstoy</db> established a school for peasant children on his estate. Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police. Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture. He thought that "Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself ... Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary". For him "without compulsion, education was transformed into culture".
A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of <db id=/Unschooling>unschooling</db> and the <db id=/Anarchist_free_school>free school</db> in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to <db id=/A._s._neill>A. S. Neill</db> founding what became <db id=/Summerhill_school>Summerhill School</db> in 1921. Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice. However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political <db id=/Class_struggle>class struggle</db>-approach.
In addition to organizing schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term <db id=/Deschooling>deschooling</db> was popularized by <db id=/Ivan_illich>Ivan Illich</db>, who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.
Criticisms.
Criticisms of anarchism include <db id=/Morality>moral</db> criticisms and pragmatic criticisms.

Autism

Autism is a <db id=/Neurodevelopmental_disorder>disorder of neural development</db> characterized by impaired <db id=/Interpersonal_relationship>social interaction</db> and <db id=/Communication>communication</db>, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old. Autism affects information processing in the <db id=/Human_brain>brain</db> by altering how nerve cells and their <db id=/Synapse>synapses</db> connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. It is one of three recognized disorders in the <db id=/Autism_spectrum>autism spectrum</db> (ASDs), the other two being <db id=/Asperger_syndrome>Asperger syndrome</db>, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and <db id=/Pdd-nos>pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified</db> (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.
Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the <db id=/Heritability_of_autism>genetics of autism</db> are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare <db id=/Mutation>mutations</db>, or by rare combinations of common genetic variants. In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with <db id=/Teratology>agents that cause birth defects</db>. <db id=/Controversies_in_autism>Controversies</db> surround other proposed environmental <db id=/Causes_of_autism>causes</db>, such as <db id=/Heavy_metal_(chemistry)>heavy metals</db>, <db id=/Pesticide>pesticides</db> or childhood <db id=/Vaccine>vaccines</db>; the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence. The <db id=/Prevalence>prevalence</db> of autism is about 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide, and the <db id=/Centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</db> (CDC) report 20 per 1,000 children in the United States are diagnosed with ASD (up from 11 per 1000 in 2008). The number of people diagnosed with autism has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government-subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses; the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.
Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. The signs usually develop gradually, but some autistic children first develop more normally and then <db id=/Regressive_autism>regress</db>. <db id=/Early_intensive_behavior_intervention>Early behavioral</db> or cognitive intervention can help autistic children gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An <db id=/Sociological_and_cultural_aspects_of_autism>autistic culture</db> has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.
Characteristics.
Autism is a highly variable <db id=/Neurodevelopmental_disorder>neurodevelopmental disorder</db> that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without <db id=/Remission_(medicine)>remission</db>. Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years, and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form. It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis. Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.
Social development.
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related <db id=/Autism_spectrum_disorder>autism spectrum disorders</db> (ASD; see <db id=/#classification>Classification</db>) from other developmental disorders. People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic <db id=/Temple_grandin>Temple Grandin</db> described her inability to understand the <db id=/Social_communication>social communication</db> of <db id=/Neurotypical>neurotypicals</db>, or people with normal <db id=/Neural_development>neural development</db>, as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars".
Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from <db id=/Social_norms>social norms</db>; for example, they have less <db id=/Eye_contact>eye contact</db> and turn taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as the deficiency to point at things. Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form <db id=/Attachment_(psychology)>attachments</db> to their primary caregivers. Most autistic children display moderately less <db id=/Attachment_in_children#secure_attachment>attachment security</db> than non-autistic children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition. For further information on facial recognition and processing in individuals with ASD, see the autism and facial recognition section of <db id=/Face_perception>face perception</db>.
Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.
There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with mental retardation, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and <db id=/Tantrum>tantrums</db>. A 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about two-thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one-third had a history of aggression, with tantrums significantly more common than in non-autistic children with language impairments. A 2008 Swedish study found that, of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of ASD, those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as <db id=/Psychosis>psychosis</db>.
Communication.
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of <db id=/Babbling>babbling</db>, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words (<db id=/Echolalia>echolalia</db>) or <db id=/Pronoun_reversal>reverse pronouns</db>. <db id=/Joint_attention>Joint attention</db> seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.
In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.
Repetitive behavior.
Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.
No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.
Other symptoms.
Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.
An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious <db id=/Savant_syndrome>autistic savants</db>. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population.
<db id=/Sensory_system>Sensory</db> abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements).
An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include <db id=/Poor_muscle_tone>poor muscle tone</db>, <db id=/Apraxia>poor motor planning</db>, and <db id=/Toe_walking>toe walking</db>; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.
Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur; this does not appear to result in <db id=/Malnutrition>malnutrition</db>. Although some children with autism also have <db id=/Gastrointestinal>gastrointestinal</db> (GI) symptoms, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different GI symptoms than usual; studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between GI problems and ASD is unclear.
Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of <db id=/Stress_(psychological)>stress</db>. Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with <db id=/Down_syndrome>Down syndrome</db> in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with <db id=/Down_syndrome>Down syndrome</db>; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.
Classification.
Autism is one of the five <db id=/Pervasive_developmental_disorder>pervasive developmental disorders</db> (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior. These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.
Of the five PDD forms, <db id=/Asperger_syndrome>Asperger syndrome</db> is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; <db id=/Rett_syndrome>Rett syndrome</db> and <db id=/Childhood_disintegrative_disorder>childhood disintegrative disorder</db> share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; <db id=/Pdd_not_otherwise_specified>PDD not otherwise specified</db> (PDD-NOS; also called "atypical autism") is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder. Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in <db id=/Language_development>language development</db>. The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the "autism spectrum disorders" (ASD) or sometimes the "autistic disorders", whereas autism itself is often called "autistic disorder", "childhood autism", or "infantile autism". In this article, "autism" refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, "autism", "ASD", and "PDD" are often used interchangeably. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism <db id=/Phenotype>phenotype</db>, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like <db id=/Trait_(biology)>traits</db>, such as avoiding eye contact.
The manifestations of autism cover a wide <db id=/Spectrum_disorder>spectrum</db>, ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, <db id=/Mentally_disabled>mentally disabled</db>, and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, <db id=/Pedantic>pedantic</db> communication. Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or <db id=/High-functioning_autism>high-functioning autism</db> (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on <db id=/Iq>IQ</db> thresholds, or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial. Autism can also be divided into <db id=/Syndrome>syndromal</db> and non-syndromal autism; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound <db id=/Mental_retardation>mental retardation</db> or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as <db id=/Tuberous_sclerosis>tuberous sclerosis</db>. Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the <db id=/Diagnosis_of_asperger_syndrome#differences_from_high-functioning_autism>overlap between Asperger syndrome, HFA, and non-syndromal autism</db> is unclear.
Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress, typically from 15 to 30 months of age. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that <db id=/Regressive_autism>regressive autism</db> is a specific subtype, or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression.
Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of <db id=/Psychiatry>psychiatry</db>, <db id=/Psychology>psychology</db>, <db id=/Neurology>neurology</db> and <db id=/Pediatrics>pediatrics</db>. Newer technologies such as <db id=/Fmri>fMRI</db> and <db id=/Diffusion_tensor_imaging>diffusion tensor imaging</db> can help identify biologically relevant <db id=/Phenotype>phenotypes</db> (observable traits) that can be viewed on <db id=/Brain_scan>brain scans</db>, to help further <db id=/Neurogenetic>neurogenetic</db> studies of autism; one example is lowered activity in the <db id=/Fusiform_face_area>fusiform face area</db> of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects. It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.
Causes.
It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms. However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.
Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the <db id=/Heritability_of_autism>genetics of autism</db> are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare <db id=/Mutation>mutations</db> with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and <db id=/Epigenetic>epigenetic</db> factors which do not change <db id=/Dna>DNA</db> but are heritable and influence <db id=/Gene_expression>gene expression</db>. Studies of twins suggest that <db id=/Heritability>heritability</db> is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population. However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a <db id=/Mendelian>Mendelian</db> (single-gene) mutation or to a single <db id=/Chromosome_abnormality>chromosome abnormality</db>, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD. Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene. The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from <db id=/Copy_number_variation>copy number variations</db>—spontaneous <db id=/Deletion_(genetics)>deletions</db> or <db id=/Gene_duplication>duplications</db> in genetic material during <db id=/Meiosis>meiosis</db>. Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome.
Several lines of evidence point to <db id=/Synapse>synaptic</db> dysfunction as a cause of autism. Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with <db id=/Cell_adhesion>cell adhesion</db>. Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes. All known <db id=/Teratogen>teratogens</db> (agents that cause <db id=/Birth_defect>birth defects</db>) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from <db id=/Human_fertilization>conception</db>, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.
Although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies, extensive searches are underway. <db id=/Environmental_factor>Environmental factors</db> that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism, or may be important in future research, include certain foods, <db id=/Infectious_disease>infectious disease</db>, <db id=/Heavy_metals>heavy metals</db>, <db id=/Solvent>solvents</db>, <db id=/Diesel_exhaust>diesel exhaust</db>, <db id=/Pcbs>PCBs</db>, <db id=/Phthalates>phthalates</db> and <db id=/Phenol>phenols</db> used in <db id=/Plastic>plastic</db> products, <db id=/Pesticide>pesticides</db>, <db id=/Brominated_flame_retardant>brominated flame retardants</db>, <db id=/Ethanol>alcohol</db>, <db id=/Smoking>smoking</db>, <db id=/Illicit_drug>illicit drugs</db>, <db id=/Vaccine>vaccines</db>, and <db id=/Prenatal_stress>prenatal stress</db>, although no links have been found, and some have been completely disproven.
Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to unsupported theories blaming <db id=/Vaccine_controversy#vaccine_overload>vaccine "overload"</db>, a <db id=/Thiomersal_controversy>vaccine preservative</db>, or the <db id=/Mmr_vaccine_controversy>MMR vaccine</db> for causing autism. The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been "an elaborate fraud". Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of <db id=/Childhood_immunizations>childhood immunizations</db>, <db id=/Mmr_vaccine_controversy#disease_outbreaks>outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases</db> in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.
Mechanism.
Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. How autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the <db id=/Pathophysiology>pathophysiology</db> of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the <db id=/Neuropsychological>neuropsychological</db> linkages between brain structures and behaviors. The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.
Pathophysiology.
Unlike many other brain disorders, such as <db id=/Parkinson's>Parkinson's</db>, autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular, cellular, or systems level; it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways, or is (like intellectual disability) a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms. Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product. <db id=/Neuroanatomical>Neuroanatomical</db> studies and the associations with <db id=/Teratogens>teratogens</db> strongly suggest that autism's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors. Just after birth, the brains of autistic children tend to grow faster than usual, followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood. It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all autistic children. It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization. Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following:
Interactions between the <db id=/Immune_system>immune system</db> and the <db id=/Nervous_system>nervous system</db> begin early during the <db id=/Human_embryogenesis>embryonic stage</db> of life, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. Aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is possibly part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD. Although some abnormalities in the immune system have been found in specific subgroups of autistic individuals, it is not known whether these abnormalities are relevant to or secondary to autism's disease processes. As <db id=/Autoantibodies>autoantibodies</db> are found in conditions other than ASD, and are not always present in ASD, the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial.
The relationship of <db id=/Neurochemical>neurochemicals</db> to autism is not well understood; several have been investigated, with the most evidence for the role of <db id=/Serotonin>serotonin</db> and of genetic differences in its transport. The role of group I <db id=/Metabotropic_glutamate_receptors>metabotropic glutamate receptors</db> (mGluR) in the pathogenesis of <db id=/Fragile_x_syndrome>fragile X syndrome</db>, the most common identified genetic cause of autism, has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway. Some data suggest an increase in several <db id=/Growth_hormone>growth hormones</db>; other data argue for diminished <db id=/Growth_factor>growth factors</db>. Also, some <db id=/Inborn_errors_of_metabolism>inborn errors of metabolism</db> are associated with autism, but probably account for less than 5% of cases.
The <db id=/Mirror_neuron_system>mirror neuron system</db> (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions. Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD, delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome, and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD. However, individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of autistic children on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object.
ASD-related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks.
In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the <db id=/Default_network>default network</db>, a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing, with intact connectivity of the <db id=/Task-positive_network>task-positive network</db>, used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking. In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time, suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks, possibly reflecting a disturbance of <db id=/Self-referential>self-referential</db> thought. A 2008 brain-imaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the <db id=/Cingulate_cortex>cingulate cortex</db> which differs in individuals with ASD.
The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization, along with an excess of low-level processes. Evidence for this theory has been found in <db id=/Functional_neuroimaging>functional neuroimaging</db> studies on autistic individuals and by a <db id=/Electroencephalography>brainwave</db> study that suggested that adults with ASD have local overconnectivity in the <db id=/Cerebral_cortex>cortex</db> and weak functional connections between the <db id=/Frontal_lobe>frontal lobe</db> and the rest of the cortex. Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each <db id=/Cerebral_hemisphere>hemisphere</db> of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the <db id=/Association_areas>association cortex</db>.
From studies based on <db id=/Event-related_potential>event-related potentials</db>, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientiation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli. For example, <db id=/Magnetoencephalography>magnetoencephalography</db> studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals.
In the genetic area, relations have been found between autism and <db id=/Schizophrenia>schizophrenia</db> based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes; research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with <db id=/1q21.1_deletion_syndrome>1q21.1 deletion syndrome</db>. Research on autism/schizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 (15q13.3), chromosome 16 (16p13.1) and chromosome 17 (17p12) are inconclusive.
Neuropsychology.
Two major categories of <db id=/Cognitive>cognitive</db> theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.
The first category focuses on deficits in <db id=/Social_cognition>social cognition</db>. The <db id=/Empathizing–systemizing_theory>empathizing–systemizing theory</db> postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing; this extension is controversial, as many studies contradict the idea that baby boys and girls respond differently to people and objects.
These theories are somewhat related to the earlier <db id=/Theory_of_mind>theory of mind</db> approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by autistic children's atypical responses to the <db id=/Sally–anne_test>Sally–Anne test</db> for reasoning about others' motivations, and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in "<db id=/#pathophysiology>Pathophysiology</db>" maps well to the hypothesis. However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.
The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the <db id=/Executive_functions>executive functions</db> such as <db id=/Working_memory>working memory</db>, planning, <db id=/Inhibition_theory>inhibition</db>. In his review, Kenworthy states that "the claim of <db id=/Executive_dysfunction>executive dysfunction</db> as a causal factor in autism is controversial", however, "it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism". Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels. A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children.
<db id=/Weak_central_coherence_theory>Weak central coherence theory</db> hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people. A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and <db id=/Perceptual>perceptual</db> operations in autistic individuals. These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.
Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties. A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.
Screening.
About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months. According to an article in the "Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders", failure to meet any of the following milestones "is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome".
US and Japanese practice is to <db id=/Screening_(medicine)>screen</db> all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests. In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. It is not known which approach is more effective. Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on M-CHAT and its predecessor CHAT on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low <db id=/Sensitivity_(tests)>sensitivity</db> (many false-negatives) but good <db id=/Specificity_(tests)>specificity</db> (few false-positives). It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders. Screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture. Although <db id=/Genetic_screening>genetic screening</db> for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and <db id=/Dysmorphic_feature>dysmorphic features</db>.
Diagnosis.
<db id=/Medical_diagnosis>Diagnosis</db> is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism. Autism is defined in the <db id=/Dsm-iv-tr>DSM-IV-TR</db> as exhibiting at least six symptoms total, including at least two symptoms of qualitative impairment in social interaction, at least one symptom of qualitative impairment in communication, and at least one symptom of restricted and repetitive behavior. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or <db id=/Idiosyncrasy#psychiatry_and_psychology>idiosyncratic language</db>, and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. Onset must be prior to age three years, with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by <db id=/Rett_syndrome>Rett syndrome</db> or <db id=/Childhood_disintegrative_disorder>childhood disintegrative disorder</db>. <db id=/Icd-10>ICD-10</db> uses essentially the same definition.
Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the <db id=/Autism_diagnostic_interview-revised>Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised</db> (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the <db id=/Autism_diagnostic_observation_schedule>Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule</db> (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The <db id=/Childhood_autism_rating_scale>Childhood Autism Rating Scale</db> (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.
A <db id=/Pediatrician>pediatrician</db> commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated <db id=/Medical_conditions>medical conditions</db>. A pediatric <db id=/Neuropsychologist>neuropsychologist</db> is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions. A <db id=/Differential_diagnosis>differential diagnosis</db> for ASD at this stage might also consider <db id=/Mental_retardation>mental retardation</db>, <db id=/Hearing_impairment>hearing impairment</db>, and a <db id=/Specific_language_impairment>specific language impairment</db> such as <db id=/Landau–kleffner_syndrome>Landau–Kleffner syndrome</db>. The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as <db id=/Mood_disorder>depression</db>.
<db id=/Clinical_genetics>Clinical genetics</db> evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause. Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes, consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and <db id=/Fragile_x>fragile X</db> testing. A <db id=/Genotype>genotype</db>-first model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations. As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics. <db id=/Metabolic>Metabolic</db> and <db id=/Neuroimaging>neuroimaging</db> tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.
ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later. In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice. A 2009 US study found the average age of formal ASD diagnosis was 5.7 years, far above recommendations, and that 27% of children remained undiagnosed at age 8 years. Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.
Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis. It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the <db id=/Visually_impaired>visually impaired</db>, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or <db id=/Blindism>blindisms</db>.
Management.
The main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs. Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment. Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about <db id=/Efficacy>efficacy</db>. Although many <db id=/Psychosocial>psychosocial</db> interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of <db id=/Systematic_review>systematic reviews</db> of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Intensive, sustained <db id=/Special_education>special education</db> programs and <db id=/Behavior_therapy>behavior therapy</db> early in life can help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. Available approaches include <db id=/Applied_behavior_analysis>applied behavior analysis</db> (ABA), developmental models, <db id=/Teacch>structured teaching</db>, <db id=/Speech_and_language_therapy>speech and language therapy</db>, <db id=/Social_skills>social skills</db> therapy, and <db id=/Occupational_therapy>occupational therapy</db>.
Educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children: <db id=/Early_intensive_behavioral_intervention>intensive ABA treatment</db> has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well-established for improving intellectual performance of young children. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up, and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results. The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers.
Many medications are used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed <db id=/Psychoactive_drug>psychoactive drugs</db> or <db id=/Anticonvulsant>anticonvulsants</db>, with the most common drug classes being <db id=/Antidepressant>antidepressants</db>, <db id=/Stimulant>stimulants</db>, and <db id=/Antipsychotic>antipsychotics</db>. Aside from antipsychotics, there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications, the medications can have <db id=/Adverse_effect_(medicine)>adverse effects</db>, and no known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments. Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism.
Although many <db id=/Alternative_therapies_for_developmental_and_learning_disabilities>alternative therapies and interventions</db> are available, few are supported by scientific studies. Treatment approaches have little empirical support in <db id=/Quality_of_life>quality-of-life</db> contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing, training availability, and parent requests. Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk. A 2008 study found that compared to their peers, autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on <db id=/Casein-free_diet>casein-free diets</db>; in 2005, botched <db id=/Chelation_therapy>chelation therapy</db> killed a five-year-old child with autism.
Treatment is expensive; indirect costs are more so. For someone born in 2000, a US study estimated an average lifetime cost of $ (<db id=/Net_present_value>net present value</db> in dollars, inflation-adjusted from 2003 estimate), with about 10% <db id=/Medical_care>medical care</db>, 30% extra education and other care, and 60% lost economic productivity. Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child, and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems; one 2008 US study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD, and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that <db id=/Child_care>child care</db> problems will greatly affect parental employment. US states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services, shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance. After childhood, key treatment issues include residential care, job training and placement, sexuality, social skills, and <db id=/Estate_planning>estate planning</db>.
Prognosis.
There is no known cure. Children recover occasionally, so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not. It is not known how often recovery happens; reported rates in unselected samples of children with ASD have ranged from 3% to 25%. Most autistic children can acquire language by age 5 or younger, though a few have developed communication skills in later years. Most children with autism lack <db id=/Social_support>social support</db>, meaningful relationships, future employment opportunities or <db id=/Self-determination_theory>self-determination</db>. Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.
Few high-quality studies address long-term <db id=/Prognosis>prognosis</db>. Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline; no study has focused on autism after midlife. Acquiring language before age six, having an <db id=/Iq>IQ</db> above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; <db id=/Independent_living>independent living</db> is unlikely with severe autism. A 2004 British study of 68 adults who were diagnosed before 1980 as autistic children with IQ above 50 found that 12% achieved a high level of independence as adults, 10% had some friends and were generally in work but required some support, 19% had some independence but were generally living at home and needed considerable support and supervision in daily living, 46% needed specialist residential provision from facilities specializing in ASD with a high level of support and very limited autonomy, and 12% needed high-level hospital care. A 2005 Swedish study of 78 adults that did not exclude low IQ found worse prognosis; for example, only 4% achieved independence. A 2008 Canadian study of 48 young adults diagnosed with ASD as preschoolers found outcomes ranging through poor (46%), fair (32%), good (17%), and very good (4%); 56% of these young adults had been employed at some point during their lives, mostly in volunteer, sheltered or <db id=/Part-time>part-time</db> work. Changes in diagnostic practice and increased availability of effective early intervention make it unclear whether these findings can be generalized to recently diagnosed children.
Epidemiology.
Most recent <db id=/Review>reviews</db> tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD, and 11 per 1,000 children in the United States for ASD as of 2008; because of inadequate data, these numbers may underestimate ASD's true prevalence. <db id=/Pdd-nos>PDD-NOS</db>'s prevalence has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and <db id=/Childhood_disintegrative_disorder>childhood disintegrative disorder</db> at 0.02 per 1,000. The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s. This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness, though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out. The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism's true prevalence has increased; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.
Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with mental retardation and more than 5.5:1 without. Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy. The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism. Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.
Several other conditions are common in children with autism. They include:
History.
A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The "<db id=/Table_talk_(luther)>Table Talk</db>" of <db id=/Martin_luther>Martin Luther</db>, compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic. Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report. The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance. The <db id=/Wild_boy_of_aveyron>Wild Boy of Aveyron</db>, a <db id=/Feral_child>feral child</db> caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student <db id=/Jean_marc_gaspard_itard>Jean Itard</db> treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.
The <db id=/New_latin>New Latin</db> word "autismus" (English translation "autism") was coined by the <db id=/Swiss>Swiss</db> psychiatrist <db id=/Eugen_bleuler>Eugen Bleuler</db> in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of <db id=/Schizophrenia>schizophrenia</db>. He derived it from the Greek word "autós" (αὐτός, meaning "self"), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to "autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance".
The word "autism" first took its modern sense in 1938 when <db id=/Hans_asperger>Hans Asperger</db> of the <db id=/Vienna_general_hospital>Vienna University Hospital</db> adopted Bleuler's terminology "autistic psychopaths" in a lecture in German about <db id=/Child_psychology>child psychology</db>. Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as <db id=/Asperger_syndrome>Asperger syndrome</db>, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981. <db id=/Leo_kanner>Leo Kanner</db> of the <db id=/Johns_hopkins_hospital>Johns Hopkins Hospital</db> first used "autism" in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label "early infantile autism" in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities. Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably "autistic aloneness" and "insistence on sameness", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders. It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.
Kanner's reuse of "autism" led to decades of confused terminology like "infantile schizophrenia", and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to "<db id=/Refrigerator_mother>refrigerator mothers</db>". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong, distinguishing it from mental retardation and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders, and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy. As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions. Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD, parents continue to feel <db id=/Social_stigma>social stigma</db> in situations where their autistic children's behaviors are perceived negatively by others, and many <db id=/Primary_care_physician>primary care physicians</db> and <db id=/Medical_specialist>medical specialists</db> still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.
The <db id=/Internet>Internet</db> has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. <db id=/Sociological_and_cultural_aspects_of_autism>Sociological and cultural aspects of autism</db> have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.

<doc id="39" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39" title="Albedo">
Albedo

Albedo, or "reflection coefficient", derived from <db id=/Latin>Latin</db> "albedo" "whiteness" (or reflected sunlight), in turn from "albus" "white", is the <db id=/Diffuse_reflection>diffuse reflectivity</db> or reflecting power of a surface. It is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it. Being a <db id=/Dimensionless_number>dimensionless</db> fraction, it may also be expressed as a percentage, and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface, to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface.
Albedo depends on the <db id=/Frequency>frequency</db> of the radiation. When quoted unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of <db id=/Visible_light>visible light</db>. In general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incoming radiation. Exceptions are <db id=/Lambertian>Lambertian</db> surfaces, which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function, so their albedo does not depend on the incident distribution. In practice, a <db id=/Bidirectional_reflectance_distribution_function>bidirectional reflectance distribution function</db> (BRDF) may be required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately, although the albedo is a very useful first approximation.
The albedo is an important concept in <db id=/Climatology>climatology</db> and <db id=/Astronomy>astronomy</db>, as well as in calculating <db id=/Reflectivity>reflectivity</db> of surfaces in LEED sustainable rating systems for buildings. The average overall albedo of Earth, its "planetary albedo", is 30 to 35%, because of the covering by clouds, but varies widely locally across the surface, depending on the geological and environmental features.
The term was introduced into optics by <db id=/Johann_heinrich_lambert>Johann Heinrich Lambert</db> in his 1760 work "<db id=/Photometria>Photometria</db>".
Terrestrial albedo.
Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0.9 for fresh snow, to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a <db id=/Black_body>black body</db>. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4. The average albedo of the <db id=/Earth>Earth</db> is about 0.3. This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.
Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.
The classic example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature <db id=/Feedback>feedback</db>. If a snow-covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is also true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of <db id=/Insolation>insolation</db>; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.
The Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via <db id=/Earth_observation>Earth observation</db> satellite sensors such as <db id=/Nasa>NASA</db>'s <db id=/Modis>MODIS</db> instruments on board the <db id=/Terra_(satellite)>Terra</db> and <db id=/Aqua_(satellite)>Aqua</db> satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a <db id=/Mathematical_model>mathematical model</db> of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of <db id=/Directional-hemispherical_reflectance>directional-hemispherical reflectance</db> and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.).
The Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the <db id=/Greenhouse_effect>greenhouse effect</db> is currently about 15 °C. If the Earth was frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective) the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40 °C If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 °C. In contrast, if all the ice on Earth were to melt—a so-called aquaplanet—the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27 °C.
White-sky and black-sky albedo.
It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular solar <db id=/Celestial_coordinate_system>zenith angle</db> formula_1 can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, formula_2, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, formula_3 the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination formula_4.
Albedo formula_5 can then be given as:
<db id=/Directional-hemispherical_reflectance>Directional-hemispherical reflectance</db> is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and <db id=/Bi-hemispherical_reflectance>bi-hemispherical reflectance</db> as white-sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.
Astronomical albedo.
The albedos of <db id=/Planet>planets</db>, <db id=/Natural_satellites>satellites</db> and <db id=/Asteroid>asteroids</db> can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of <db id=/Photometry_(astronomy)>photometry</db>. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about <db id=/Regolith>regolith</db> properties, while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in <db id=/Asteroid>asteroids</db>.
<db id=/Enceladus_(moon)>Enceladus</db>, a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high-albedo body is <db id=/Eris_(dwarf_planet)>Eris</db>, with an albedo of 0.96
. Many small objects in the outer solar system and <db id=/Asteroid_belt>asteroid belt</db> have low albedos down to about 0.05. A typical <db id=/Comet_nucleus>comet nucleus</db> has an albedo of 0.04. Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily <db id=/Space_weathering>space weathered</db> surface containing some <db id=/Organic_compound>organic compounds</db>.
The overall albedo of the <db id=/Moon>Moon</db> is around 0.12, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect. While such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the <db id=/Regolith>regolith</db> surfaces of airless solar system bodies.
Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) <db id=/Geometric_albedo>geometric albedo</db> (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the <db id=/Bond_albedo>Bond albedo</db> (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.
In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five <db id=/Hapke_parameters>Hapke parameters</db> which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with <db id=/Phase_angle_(astronomy)>phase angle</db>, including a characterization of the <db id=/Opposition_effect>opposition effect</db> of <db id=/Regolith>regolith</db> surfaces.
The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, <db id=/Absolute_magnitude#absolute_magnitude_for_planets_(h)>absolute magnitude</db> and diameter is:
formula_7,
where formula_8 is the astronomical albedo, formula_9 is the diameter in kilometers, and "H" is the absolute magnitude.
Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.
Illumination.
Although the albedo–temperature effect is best known in colder, whiter regions on Earth, the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year-round illumination is greater. The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere, varying between 3 and 12 degrees north. The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres, beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination.
Small-scale effects.
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.
Trees.
Because forests are generally attributed a low albedo, (as the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through <db id=/Photosynthesis>photosynthesis</db>), it has been erroneously assumed that removing forests would lead to cooling on the grounds of increased albedo. Through the <db id=/Evapotranspiration>evapotranspiration</db> of water, trees discharge excess heat from the forest canopy. This water vapour rises resulting in <db id=/Cloud_cover>cloud cover</db> which also has a high albedo, thereby further increasing the net global cooling effect attributable to forests.
In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. <db id=/Deciduous_trees>Deciduous trees</db> have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas <db id=/Coniferous_trees>coniferous trees</db> have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.
Studies by the <db id=/Hadley_centre>Hadley Centre</db> have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of <db id=/Carbon_sequestration>carbon sequestration</db> on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.
Snow.
Snow albedos can be as high as 0.9; this, however, is for the ideal example: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over <db id=/Antarctica>Antarctica</db> they average a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo <db id=/Positive_feedback>positive feedback</db>). <db id=/Cryoconite>Cryoconite</db>, powdery windblown <db id=/Dust>dust</db> containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.
Water.
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the <db id=/Fresnel_equations>Fresnel equations</db> (see graph).
At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally <db id=/Specular_reflection>specular manner</db> (not <db id=/Diffuse_reflection>diffusely</db>). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small <db id=/Angle_of_incidence>angles of incident</db> light, <db id=/Waviness>waviness</db> results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.
Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the Earth near the <db id=/Terminator_(solar)>terminator</db> (early morning, late afternoon and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.
Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh ‘black’ ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.
Clouds.
<db id=/Cloud_albedo>Cloud albedo</db> has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. "On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth."
Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the <db id=/Contrail>contrails</db> of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 °C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.
Aerosol effects.
<db id=/Aerosols>Aerosols</db> (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on the Earth’s radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as <db id=/Cloud_condensation_nuclei>cloud condensation nuclei</db> and thereby change <db id=/Cloud>cloud</db> properties) is less certain. As per the effects are:
Black carbon.
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the <db id=/Intergovernmental_panel_on_climate_change>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</db> estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m−2, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m−2.
Other types of albedo.
<db id=/Single-scattering_albedo>Single-scattering albedo</db> is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material (<db id=/Refractive_index>refractive index</db>); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

A

A (<db id=/English_alphabet#letter_names>named</db> "a" , plural "aes") is the first <db id=/Letter_(alphabet)>letter</db> and <db id=/Vowel>vowel</db> in the <db id=/Iso_basic_latin_alphabet>ISO basic Latin alphabet</db>. It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter <db id=/Alpha>alpha</db>, from which it derives.
Origins.
The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is <db id=/Aleph>aleph</db> (also called 'aleph), the first letter of the <db id=/Phoenician_alphabet>Phoenician alphabet</db> (which, by consisting entirely of <db id=/Consonant>consonants</db>, is an <db id=/Abjad>abjad</db> rather than a true <db id=/Alphabet>alphabet</db>). In turn, the origin of aleph may have been a <db id=/Pictogram>pictogram</db> of an <db id=/Ox>ox</db> head in <db id=/Egyptian_hieroglyph>Egyptian hieroglyphs</db>, styled as a triangular head with 2 horns extended.
In 1600 B.C.E., the <db id=/Phoenician_alphabet>Phoenician alphabet</db>'s letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name must have corresponded closely to the <db id=/Hebrew_alphabet>Hebrew</db> or <db id=/Arabic_script>Arabic</db> <db id=/Aleph>aleph</db>.
When the <db id=/Ancient_greece>ancient Greeks</db> adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the <db id=/Glottal_stop>glottal stop</db>—the first <db id=/Phoneme>phoneme</db> of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter, and the sound that the letter denoted in <db id=/Phoenician_languages>Phoenician</db> and other <db id=/Semitic_languages>Semitic languages</db>—so they used an adaptation of the sign to represent the vowel , and gave it the similar name of <db id=/Alpha_(letter)>alpha</db>. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the <db id=/Greek_dark_ages>Greek Dark Ages</db>, dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the <db id=/Greek_alphabet>Greek alphabet</db> of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.
The <db id=/Etruscans>Etruscans</db> brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the <db id=/Italian_peninsula>Italian Peninsula</db> and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the <db id=/Old_italic_alphabet>Etruscan alphabet</db> to write the <db id=/Latin_language>Latin language</db>, and the resulting letter was preserved in the <db id=/Latin_script>Latin alphabet</db> used to write many languages, including <db id=/English_language>English</db>.
During Roman times there were many variations on the letter "A". First, was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other "permanent" mediums. For perishable surfaces, what was used for everyday or utilitarian purposes, a cursive style was used. Due to the "perishable" nature of the surfaces, these examples are not as prevalent as the monumental. This perishable style was called cursive and numerous variations have survived, such as majuscule cursive, miniscule cursive, semicursive miniscule. There were also variants that were intermediate between the monumental and the cursive. The known variants include the early semiuncial, the uncial, and the later semiuncial.
At the termination of the <db id=/Roman_empire>Roman Empire</db> (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive miniscule appeared through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive miniscule of <db id=/Italy>Italy</db>, the <db id=/Merovingian>Merovingian</db> script in <db id=/France>France</db>, the <db id=/Visigothic>Visigothic</db> script in <db id=/Spain>Spain</db>, and the <db id=/Insular>Insular</db> or Anglo-Irish semiuncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule, of <db id=/Great_britain>Great Britain</db>. By the 9th century, the <db id=/Caroline_script>Caroline script</db>, which was very similar to the present day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms. 
15th century Italy saw the formation of the two variants that we know today. These variants, the "Italics" and "Roman" forms were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italics form used in most current <db id=/Handwriting>handwriting</db> consists of a circle and vertical stroke (), called <db id=/Latin_alpha>Latin alpha</db> or "script a". This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter <db id=/Tau>tau</db> in the hands of dark-age Irish and English writers. Most printed material uses the Roman form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it (). Both derive from the <db id=/Majuscule>majuscule</db> (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the Uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the <db id=/Serif>serif</db> that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.
Use in English.
In <db id=/English_language>English</db>, the letter A currently represents six different vowel sounds: A by itself frequently denotes the <db id=/Near-open_front_unrounded_vowel>near-open front unrounded vowel</db> () as in "pad"; the <db id=/Open_back_unrounded_vowel>open back unrounded vowel</db> () ; a closer, further fronted sound as in "hare", which developed as the sound progressed from "father" to "ace"; in concert with a later orthographic vowel, the diphthong as in "ace" and "major", due to effects of the <db id=/Great_vowel_shift>great vowel shift</db>; the more rounded form in "water" or its closely related cousin, found in "was".
The double "a" sequence is not a native English combination; however it is used this way in some foreign words such as "Aaron" and "aardvark".
"A" is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after "E" and "T"), and the second most common in <db id=/Spanish_language>Spanish</db> and <db id=/French_language>French</db>. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English tend to be 'a', while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French.
"A" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; "A grade" for clean restaurants; <db id=/A-list>A-List</db> celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a <db id=/Motivation>motivating</db> effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.
The letter "A" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet are used in <db id=/Algebra>algebra</db> to represent known quantities. Whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (x,y,z) are used to denote unknown quantities. Also, in <db id=/Geometry>geometry</db>, the capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote <db id=/Segment>segments</db>, <db id=/Line>lines</db>, <db id=/Ray>rays</db>, etc.
Use in other languages.
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, A denotes an open unrounded vowel: , , or . An exception is <db id=/Saanich_language>Saanich</db>, in which A (and <db id=/Á>Á</db>) stand for a <db id=/Close-mid_front_unrounded_vowel>close-mid front unrounded vowel</db> . In the , variants of A denote various <db id=/Vowel>vowels</db>. In <db id=/X-sampa>X-SAMPA</db>, capital A denotes the <db id=/Open_back_unrounded_vowel>open back unrounded vowel</db> and lowercase a denotes the <db id=/Open_front_unrounded_vowel>open front unrounded vowel</db>.

Alabama

Alabama () is a <db id=/U.s._state>state</db> located in the <db id=/Southern_united_states>southeastern region</db> of the <db id=/United_states>United States</db>. It is bordered by <db id=/Tennessee>Tennessee</db> to the north, <db id=/Georgia_(u.s._state)>Georgia</db> to the east, <db id=/Florida>Florida</db> and the <db id=/Gulf_of_mexico>Gulf of Mexico</db> to the south, and <db id=/Mississippi>Mississippi</db> to the west. Alabama is the <db id=/List_of_u.s._states_and_territories_by_area>30th-most extensive</db> and the <db id=/List_of_u.s._states_and_territories_by_population>23rd-most populous</db> of the <db id=/List_of_u.s._states>50 United States</db>. At , Alabama has one of the longest navigable inland waterways in the nation.
From the <db id=/American_civil_war>American Civil War</db> until <db id=/World_war_ii>World War II</db>, Alabama, like many Southern states, suffered economic hardship, in part because of continued dependence on agriculture. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, <db id=/White_american>white</db> rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s, while urban interests and <db id=/African_americans>African Americans</db> were under-represented.
Following World War II, Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The establishment or expansion of multiple <db id=/United_states_armed_forces>United States Armed Forces</db> installations added to the state economy and helped bridge the gap between an agricultural and industrial economy during the mid-20th century. The state economy in the 21st century is dependent on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.
Alabama is unofficially nicknamed the "<db id=/Northern_flicker>Yellowhammer</db> State", after the <db id=/List_of_u.s._state_birds>state bird</db>. Alabama is also known as the "<db id=/Dixie>Heart of Dixie</db>." The <db id=/List_of_u.s._state_trees>state tree</db> is the <db id=/Longleaf_pine>Longleaf Pine</db>, the <db id=/List_of_u.s._state_flowers>state flower</db> is the <db id=/Camellia>Camellia</db>. The capital of Alabama is <db id=/Montgomery,_alabama>Montgomery</db>. The largest city by population is <db id=/Birmingham,_alabama>Birmingham</db>. The largest city by total land area is <db id=/Huntsville,_alabama>Huntsville</db>. The oldest city is <db id=/Mobile,_alabama>Mobile</db>, founded by French <db id=/Colonists>colonists</db>.
History.
Etymology.
The <db id=/Alabama_people>Alabama people</db>, a <db id=/Muskogean_languages>Muskogean-speaking tribe</db> whose members lived just below the confluence of the <db id=/Coosa_river>Coosa</db> and <db id=/Tallapoosa_river>Tallapoosa Rivers</db> on the upper reaches of the <db id=/Alabama_river>Alabama River</db>, served as the <db id=/Etymology>etymological source</db> of the names of the river and state. In the <db id=/Alabama_language>Alabama language</db>, the word for an Alabama person is "Albaamo" (or variously "Albaama" or "Albàamo" in different dialects; the plural form "Alabama persons" is "Albaamaha"). The word "Alabama" is believed to have originated from the <db id=/Choctaw_language>Choctaw language</db> and was later adopted by the Alabama tribe as their name. The spelling of the word varies significantly between sources. The first usage appears in three accounts of the <db id=/Hernando_de_soto>Hernando de Soto</db> expedition of 1540 with <db id=/Garcilasso_de_la_vega>Garcilasso de la Vega</db> using "Alibamo", while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote "Alibamu" and "Limamu", respectively. As early as 1702, the tribe was known to the French as "Alibamon" with French maps identifying the river as "Rivière des Alibamons". Other spellings of the appellation have included "Alibamu", "Alabamo", "Albama", "Alebamon", "Alibama", "Alibamou", "Alabamu", and "Allibamou".
Although the origin of "Alabama" could be discerned, sources disagree on its meaning. An 1842 article in the "Jacksonville Republican" originated the idea that the meaning was "Here We Rest." This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of <db id=/Alexander_beaufort_meek>Alexander Beaufort Meek</db>. Experts in the <db id=/Muskogean_languages>Muskogean languages</db> have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation. Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw "alba" (meaning "plants" or "weeds") and "amo" (meaning "to cut", "to trim", or "to gather"). The meaning may have been "clearers of the thicket" or "herb gatherers" which may refer to clearing of land for cultivation or to collecting medicinal plants. "Alabama" is but one of many <db id=/List_of_place_names_in_alabama_of_native_american_origin>place names in the state of Native American origin</db>.
Pre-European settlement.
<db id=/Indigenous_peoples>Indigenous peoples</db> of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization. Trade with the Northeast via the <db id=/Ohio_river>Ohio River</db> began during the Burial Mound Period (1000 BC–AD 700) and continued until <db id=/European_colonization_of_the_americas>European contact</db>.
The agrarian <db id=/Mississippian_culture>Mississippian culture</db> covered most of the state from AD 1000 to 1600, with one of its major centers being at the <db id=/Moundville_archaeological_site>Moundville Archaeological Site</db> in <db id=/Moundville,_alabama>Moundville, Alabama</db>. Analysis of <db id=/Artifact_(archaeology)>artifacts</db> recovered from <db id=/Archaeological>archaeological</db> excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars' formulating the characteristics of the <db id=/Southeastern_ceremonial_complex>Southeastern Ceremonial Complex</db> (SECC). Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to <db id=/Mesoamerica>Mesoamerican</db> culture, but developed independently. The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.
Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were <db id=/Iroquoian>Iroquoian</db>-speaking <db id=/Cherokee>Cherokee</db>, and the <db id=/Muskogean>Muskogean</db>-speaking <db id=/Alabama_(people)>Alabama</db> ("Alibamu"), <db id=/Chickasaw>Chickasaw</db>, <db id=/Choctaw>Choctaw</db>, <db id=/Creek_people>Creek</db>, and <db id=/Koasati>Koasati</db>.
European settlement.
The French founded the first European settlement in the region at <db id=/Old_mobile_site>Old Mobile</db>, in 1702. The city was moved to the current site of <db id=/Mobile,_alabama>Mobile</db> in 1711. This area was French from 1702 to 1763, part of British <db id=/West_florida>West Florida</db> from 1763 to 1783, and split between the United States and Spain from 1783 to 1821. Thomas Bassett, a <db id=/Loyalist_(american_revolution)>loyalist</db> to the British monarchy, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside of the Mobile area. He settled in the <db id=/Tombigbee_district>Tombigbee settlements</db>, in what is now <db id=/Washington_county,_alabama>Washington County</db>, during the early 1770s. What is now the counties of <db id=/Baldwin_county,_alabama>Baldwin</db> and <db id=/Mobile_county>Mobile</db> became part of <db id=/Spanish_west_florida>Spanish West Florida</db> in 1783, part of the independent <db id=/Republic_of_west_florida>Republic of West Florida</db> in 1810, and was finally added to the <db id=/Mississippi_territory>Mississippi Territory</db> in 1812. The area making up today's northern and central Alabama and Mississippi, then known as the <db id=/Yazoo_lands>Yazoo lands</db>, had been claimed by the <db id=/Province_of_georgia>Province of Georgia</db> after 1767. Following the <db id=/American_revolution>Revolutionary War</db>, it remained a part of <db id=/Georgia_(u.s._state)>Georgia</db>, although heavily disputed.
With the exception of the immediate area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now central Alabama was made part of the <db id=/Mississippi_territory>Mississippi Territory</db> upon its creation in 1798. The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the <db id=/Yazoo_land_scandal>Yazoo land scandal</db>. Spain had kept a governmental presence in Mobile after 1812. When <db id=/Andrew_jackson>Andrew Jackson</db>'s forces occupied Mobile in 1814, he demonstrated the United States' "de facto" authority over the region, which effectively ended Spanish influence, although not its claim, while gaining an unencumbered passage to the Gulf of Mexico from the hinterlands of the territory. Prior to the admission of <db id=/Mississippi>Mississippi</db> as a state on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the <db id=/Alabama_territory>Alabama Territory</db>. The Alabama Territory was created by the <db id=/United_states_congress>United States Congress</db> on March 3, 1817. <db id=/St._stephens,_alabama>St. Stephens</db>, now abandoned, served as the territorial <db id=/Capital_(political)>capital</db> from 1817 to 1819.
Early statehood.
The U.S. Congress selected Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention of Alabama after it was approved to become the 22nd state. From July 5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution. Huntsville served as the temporary capital of Alabama from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of state government was moved to <db id=/Cahaba,_alabama>Cahaba</db> in <db id=/Dallas_county,_alabama>Dallas County</db>. Cahaba, now a ghost town, was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825. <db id=/Alabama_fever>Alabama Fever</db> was already underway when the state was admitted to the Union, with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation. Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men. Southeastern planters and traders from the <db id=/Upper_south>Upper South</db> brought <db id=/History_of_slavery_in_alabama>slaves</db> with them as the cotton <db id=/List_of_plantations_in_alabama>plantations in Alabama</db> expanded. The economy of the central <db id=/Black_belt_(region_of_alabama)>Black Belt</db> (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton <db id=/Plantation_complexes_in_the_southeastern_united_states>plantations</db> whose owners' wealth grew largely from slave labor. The area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became <db id=/Subsistence_farmers>subsistence farmers</db>. Alabama had a population estimated at under 10,000 people in 1810, but it had increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830. Most Native American tribes were <db id=/Indian_removal>completely removed</db> from the state within a few years of the passage of the <db id=/Indian_removal_act>Indian Removal Act</db> by Congress in 1830.
From 1826 to 1846, <db id=/Tuscaloosa,_alabama>Tuscaloosa</db> served as the capital of Alabama. On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced that it had voted to remove the capital city from Tuscaloosa to <db id=/Montgomery,_alabama>Montgomery</db>. The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847. A new capitol building was erected under the direction of <db id=/Stephen_decatur_button>Stephen Decatur Button</db> of <db id=/Philadelphia>Philadelphia</db>. The first structure burned down in 1849, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851. This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day. It was designed by Barachias Holt of <db id=/Exeter,_maine>Exeter, Maine</db>. By 1860 the population had increased to a total of 964,201 people, of which 435,080 were enslaved African Americans and 2,690 were <db id=/Free_people_of_color>free people of color</db>.
Civil War and Reconstruction.
On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its <db id=/Secession_in_the_united_states>secession</db> from the <db id=/Union_(american_civil_war)>Union</db>. After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the <db id=/Confederate_states_of_america>Confederate States of America</db>. The Confederacy's capital was initially located at <db id=/Montgomery>Montgomery</db>. Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the <db id=/American_civil_war>American Civil War</db>. Alabama's slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865. A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama joined <db id=/Nathan_bedford_forrest>Nathan Bedford Forrest</db>'s battalion in <db id=/Hopkinsville,_kentucky>Hopkinsville, Kentucky</db>. The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coat tails. This led to them being greeted with "Yellowhammer", and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army.
Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868. From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred from voting, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African American congressmen: <db id=/Jeremiah_haralson>Jeremiah Haralson</db>, <db id=/Benjamin_s._turner>Benjamin S. Turner</db>, and <db id=/James_t._rapier>James T. Rapier</db>.
Following the war, the state was remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During <db id=/Reconstruction_era_of_the_united_states>Reconstruction</db>, state legislators ratified a <db id=/Constitution_of_alabama>new state constitution</db> in 1868 that created a public school system for the first time and expanded women's rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation. Organized resistance groups also tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans. Besides the short-lived original <db id=/Ku_klux_klan>Ku Klux Klan</db>, these included the Pale Faces, <db id=/Knights_of_the_white_camellia>Knights of the White Camellia</db>, <db id=/Red_shirts_(southern_united_states)>Red Shirts</db>, and the <db id=/White_league>White League</db>.
Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office. They wrote another constitution in 1875, and the legislature passed the <db id=/Blaine_amendment>Blaine Amendment</db>, prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools. The same year, legislation was approved that called for <db id=/Racial_segregation>racially segregated</db> schools. Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891. More <db id=/Jim_crow_laws>Jim Crow laws</db> were passed at the beginning of the 20th century to enforce segregation in everyday life.
1900–1949.
The new 1901 <db id=/Constitution_of_alabama>Constitution of Alabama</db> included electoral laws that effectively <db id=/Disfranchisement_after_reconstruction_era>disfranchised</db> African Americans and most poor whites through voting restrictions, including <db id=/Poll_tax_(united_states)>poll taxes</db> and literacy requirements. While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to support these legislative efforts, the new restrictions resulted in their disfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax. In 1900, Alabama had more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote. By 1903, only 2,980 had qualified to register, although at least 74,000 black voters were <db id=/Literate>literate</db>. By 1941, more white Alabamians than black had been disfranchised: 600,000 whites to 520,000 blacks. Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote.
The 1901 constitution reiterated that schools be racially segregated. It also restated that interracial marriage was illegal, although it had already been against the law since 1867. Further racial segregation laws were passed into the 1950s: jails in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.
The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes. Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the <db id=/Rosenwald_fund>Rosenwald Fund</db> began funding the building of what came to be known as <db id=/Rosenwald_school>Rosenwald Schools</db>. In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The local community and state paid the rest. Beginning in 1913, the first 80 Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama. A total of 387 schools, 7 teacher's houses, and several vocational buildings had been completed in the state by 1937. Several of the <db id=/The_rosenwald_school_building_fund_and_associated_buildings_multiple_property_submission>surviving school buildings in the state</db> are now listed on the <db id=/National_register_of_historic_places>National Register of Historic Places</db>.
Continued racial discrimination, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to <db id=/Boll_weevil>boll weevil</db> infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans to seek opportunities in northern cities. They left Alabama in the early 20th century as part of the <db id=/Great_migration_(african_american)>Great Migration</db> to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities. The population growth rate in Alabama (see "Historical Populations" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920, reflecting this emigration.
At the same time, many rural whites and blacks moved to the city of <db id=/Birmingham,_alabama>Birmingham</db> to work in new industrial jobs. Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called "The Magic City". By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th largest city in the United States and had more than 30% of the Alabama's population. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy. Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity not seen since before the Civil War. Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers can be shown by what happened in Mobile. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war effort industries. Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.
1950–2000.
Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham.
One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, "A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature."
African Americans were presumed partial to Republicans for historical reasons, but they were disfranchised. White Alabamans felt bitter towards the Republican Party in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction. These factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with white voters had to run as a Democrat regardless of political beliefs.
Although efforts had already started decades earlier, African Americans began to more actively attempt to end the disfranchisement and segregation in the state during the 1950s and 1960s with the <db id=/African-american_civil_rights_movement_(1955–1968)>Civil Rights Movement</db>. These efforts directly led to the enactment of the <db id=/Civil_rights_act_of_1964>Civil Rights Act of 1964</db> and <db id=/Voting_rights_act_of_1965>Voting Rights Act of 1965</db> by the U.S. Congress. During the 1960s, under Governor <db id=/George_wallace>George Wallace</db>, failed attempts were made at the state level to resist federally-sanctioned <db id=/Desegregation>desegregation</db> efforts.
During the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans achieved a protection of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national <db id=/Civil_rights_act_of_1964>Civil Rights Act of 1964</db>, and the <db id=/Voting_rights_act_of_1965>Voting Rights Act of 1965</db>. Legal segregation ended in the states as <db id=/Jim_crow_laws>Jim Crow laws</db> were invalidated or repealed.
Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to redistrict by population both the House and Senate of the state legislature. In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature implemented the Alabama constitution's provision for periodic redistricting based on population. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years.
Geography.
Alabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the U.S. About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle plain with a general descent towards the <db id=/Mississippi_river>Mississippi River</db> and the <db id=/Gulf_of_mexico>Gulf of Mexico</db>. The <db id=/North_alabama>North Alabama</db> region is mostly mountainous, with the <db id=/Tennessee_river>Tennessee River</db> cutting a large valley creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.
The states bordering Alabama are Tennessee to the north; Georgia to the east; Florida to the south; and <db id=/Mississippi>Mississippi</db> to the west. Alabama has coastline at the Gulf of Mexico, in the extreme southern edge of the state. Alabama ranges in elevation from sea level at <db id=/Mobile_bay>Mobile Bay</db> to over 1,800 feet (550 m) in the <db id=/Appalachian_mountains>Appalachian Mountains</db> in the northeast. The highest point is <db id=/Mount_cheaha>Mount Cheaha</db>, at a height of . Alabama's land consists of of forest or 67% of total land area. Suburban <db id=/Baldwin_county,_alabama>Baldwin County</db>, along the Gulf Coast, is the largest county in the state in both land area and water area.
Areas in Alabama administered by the <db id=/National_park_service>National Park Service</db> include <db id=/Horseshoe_bend_national_military_park>Horseshoe Bend National Military Park</db> near <db id=/Alexander_city,_alabama>Alexander City</db>; <db id=/Little_river_canyon_national_preserve>Little River Canyon National Preserve</db> near <db id=/Fort_payne,_alabama>Fort Payne</db>; <db id=/Russell_cave_national_monument>Russell Cave National Monument</db> in <db id=/Bridgeport,_alabama>Bridgeport</db>; <db id=/Tuskegee_airmen_national_historic_site>Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site</db> in <db id=/Tuskegee,_alabama>Tuskegee</db>; and <db id=/Tuskegee_institute_national_historic_site>Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site</db> near Tuskegee. Additionally, Alabama has four <db id=/United_states_national_forest>National Forests</db>: <db id=/Conecuh_national_forest>Conecuh</db>, <db id=/Talladega_national_forest>Talladega</db>, <db id=/Tuskegee_national_forest>Tuskegee</db>, and <db id=/William_b._bankhead_national_forest>William B.

Alabama also contains the <db id=/Natchez_trace_parkway>Natchez Trace Parkway</db>, the <db id=/Selma_to_montgomery_national_historic_trail>Selma To Montgomery National Historic Trail</db>, and the <db id=/Trail_of_tears>Trail Of Tears National Historic Trail</db>. A notable natural wonder in Alabama is <db id=/Natural_bridge,_alabama>"Natural Bridge"</db> rock, the longest <db id=/Natural_bridge>natural bridge</db> east of the <db id=/Rocky_mountains>Rockies</db>, located just south of <db id=/Haleyville,_alabama>Haleyville</db>.
A -wide meteorite impact crater is located in <db id=/Elmore_county,_alabama>Elmore County</db>, just north of Montgomery. This is the <db id=/Wetumpka_crater>Wetumpka crater</db>, the site of "Alabama's greatest natural disaster." A -wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago. The hills just east of downtown <db id=/Wetumpka>Wetumpka</db> showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme ("star-wound") because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface. In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as 157th recognized impact crater on Earth.
The northernmost point of Alabama lies approximately six miles northwest of <db id=/Waterloo,_alabama>Waterloo</db> in <db id=/Lauderdale_county,_alabama>Lauderdale County</db> in the far northwest corner of the state. The southernmost point is <db id=/Sand_island_light_(alabama)>Sand Island</db>, near <db id=/Dauphin_island,_alabama>Dauphin Island</db>, in <db id=/Mobile_county,_alabama>Mobile County</db>. The easternmost point lies eight miles southeast of <db id=/Fort_mitchell,_alabama>Fort Mitchell</db> in <db id=/Russell_county,_alabama>Russell County</db> on the <db id=/Georgia_(u.s._state)>Georgia</db> border. The westernmost point is the southern third of the <db id=/Mississippi>Mississippi</db> State line, ending near the town of Melvin in <db id=/Choctaw_county,_alabama>Choctaw County</db>.
Climate.
The state is classified as <db id=/Humid_subtropical_climate>humid subtropical</db> ("Cfa") under the . The average annual temperature is 64 °F (18 °C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler. Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.
Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to <db id=/Tropical_storm>tropical storms</db> and even <db id=/Hurricane>hurricanes</db>. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.
South Alabama reports many <db id=/Thunderstorms>thunderstorms</db>. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent <db id=/Lightning>lightning</db> and large <db id=/Hail>hail</db>; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks seventh in the number of deaths from lightning and ninth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.
Alabama, along with <db id=/Kansas>Kansas</db>, has the most reported <db id=/Enhanced_fujita_scale>EF5 tornadoes</db> of any state, according to statistics from the <db id=/National_climatic_data_center>National Climatic Data Center</db> for the period January 1, 1950, to October 31, 2006. Several long-tracked F5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state, even surpassing Texas which has a much larger area within <db id=/Tornado_alley>Tornado Alley</db>. The state suffered tremendous damage in the <db id=/Super_outbreak>Super Outbreak</db> of April 1974, and the <db id=/April_25–28,_2011_tornado_outbreak>April 25–28, 2011 tornado outbreak</db>. The outbreak in April 2011 produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.
The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December, along with the spring severe weather season. The northern part of the state—along the Tennessee Valley—is one of the areas in the U.S. most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as <db id=/Dixie_alley>Dixie Alley</db>, as distinct from the <db id=/Tornado_alley>Tornado Alley</db> of the Southern Plains.
Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the southeastern U.S., with average January low temperatures around in Mobile and around in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include <db id=/New_year's_eve_1963_snowstorm>New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm</db> and the <db id=/1993_storm_of_the_century>1993 Storm of the Century</db>. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.
Alabama's highest temperature of was recorded on September 5, 1925 in the unincorporated community of <db id=/Centerville,_alabama>Centerville</db>. The record low of occurred on January 30, 1966 in <db id=/New_market,_alabama>New Market</db>.
Flora and fauna.
Alabama is home to a diverse array of <db id=/Flora>flora</db> and <db id=/Fauna>fauna</db>, due largely to a variety of habitats that range from the <db id=/Tennessee_valley>Tennessee Valley</db>, <db id=/Appalachian_plateau>Appalachian Plateau</db>, and <db id=/Ridge-and-valley_appalachians>Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians</db> of the north to the <db id=/Piedmont_(united_states)>Piedmont</db>, <db id=/Canebrake_(region_of_alabama)>Canebrake</db> and <db id=/Black_belt_(region_of_alabama)>Black Belt</db> of the central region to the <db id=/Gulf_coastal_plain>Gulf Coastal Plain</db> and beaches along the <db id=/Gulf_of_mexico>Gulf of Mexico</db> in the south. The state is usually ranked among the top in nation for its range of overall <db id=/Biodiversity>biodiversity</db>.
Alabama once boasted huge expanses of pine forest, which still form the largest proportion of forests in the state. It currently ranks fifth in the nation for the diversity of its flora. It is home to nearly 4,000 <db id=/Pteridophyte>pteridophyte</db> and <db id=/Spermatophyte>spermatophyte</db> plant species.
<db id=/Indigenous_(ecology)>Indigenous</db> animal species in the state include 62 <db id=/Mammal>mammal</db> <db id=/Species>species</db>, 93 <db id=/Reptile>reptile</db> species, 73 <db id=/Amphibian>amphibian</db> species, roughly 307 native <db id=/Freshwater_fish>freshwater fish</db> species, and 420 bird species that spend at least part of their year within the state. Invertebrates include 83 <db id=/Crayfish>crayfish</db> species and 383 <db id=/Mollusk>mollusk</db> species. 113 of these mollusk species have never been collected outside of the state.
Demographics.
The <db id=/United_states_census_bureau>United States Census Bureau</db> estimates that the population of Alabama was 4,822,023 on July 1, 2012, a 0.9% increase since the <db id=/2010_united_states_census>2010 Census</db>.
The U.S. Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2012, estimated Alabama's population at 4,822,023, which represents an increase of 42,287, or 0.9%, since the last census in 2010. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 people (that is 502,457 births minus 381,403 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 people into the state. <db id=/Immigration_to_the_united_states>Immigration</db> from outside the U.S. resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people. The state had 108,000 foreign-born (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22.2% were illegal immigrants (24,000).
The <db id=/Center_of_population>center of population</db> of Alabama is located in <db id=/Chilton_county,_alabama>Chilton County</db>, outside of the town of <db id=/Jemison,_alabama>Jemison</db>.
Race and ancestry.
According to the <db id=/2010_united_states_census>2010 Census</db>, Alabama had a population of 4,779,736. In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 68.5% White (67.0% Non-Hispanic <db id=/Non-hispanic_whites>White</db> Alone), 26.2% <db id=/African_american>Black</db> or African American, 0.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.1% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 2.0% from Some Other Race, and 1.5% from Two or More Races. <db id=/Hispanic_and_latino_americans>Hispanics</db> or Latinos of any race made up 3.9% of the population.
In 2011, 46.6% of Alabama's population younger than age 1 were minorities.
The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama are: African American (26.2%), <db id=/English_american>English</db> (23.6%), <db id=/Irish_american>Irish</db> (7.7%), <db id=/German_american>German</db> (5.7%), and <db id=/Scots-irish_american>Scots-Irish</db> (2.0%). Those citing "American" ancestry in Alabama are of overwhelmingly English extraction, however most <db id=/English_american>English Americans</db> identify simply as having American ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long, in some cases since the 1600s. Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and state that the figure is probably much higher. In the 1980 census, 41% of the people in Alabama cited that they were of English ancestry, making them the largest ethnic group at the time. There are also many more people in Alabama of <db id=/Scots-irish_american>Scots-Irish</db> origins than are self-reported. Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term <db id=/Scotch-irish_american>Scots-Irish</db>, but most of the time in Alabama this term is used for those with Scottish roots, rather than Irish.
In 1984, under the Davis–Strong Act, the state legislature established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission and <db id=/State_recognized_tribes_in_the_united_states>officially recognized</db> seven American Indian tribes. Now expanded to nine, these include the <db id=/Poarch_band_of_creek_indians>Poarch Band of Creek Indians</db>, <db id=/Mowa_band_of_choctaw_indians>MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians</db>, Star Clan of Muscogee Creeks, Echota Cherokee Tribe of Alabama, Cherokees of Northeast Alabama, Cherokees of Southeast Alabama, Ma-Chis Lower Creek Indian Tribe, Piqua Sept of Ohio Shawnee Tribe, and United Cherokee Ani-Yun-Wiya Nation.
Religion.
Christianity.
Alabama is located in the middle of the <db id=/Bible_belt>Bible Belt</db>, a region of high Christian followers. Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the US, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly. A majority of people in the state identify as Protestant. As of 2000, the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are <db id=/Evangelical_protestant>Evangelical Protestant</db>, <db id=/Mainline_protestant>Mainline Protestant</db>, and Catholic. The <db id=/Southern_baptist_convention>Southern Baptist Convention</db> has the highest number of adherents in Alabama with 1,380,121, followed by the <db id=/United_methodist_church>United Methodist Church</db> with 327,734 members, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents.
In a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian <db id=/Synoptic_gospels>Gospels</db>. Of those who indicated a religious preference, 59% said they possessed a "full understanding" of their faith and needed no further learning. In a 2007 poll, 92% of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state. In the 2008 <db id=/American_religious_identification_survey>American Religious Identification Survey</db>, 80% of Alabama respondents reported their religion as Christian, 6% as Catholic, and 11% as having no religion.
Other faiths.
Although in much smaller numbers, many other religious faiths are represented in the state as well, including <db id=/Judaism>Judaism</db>, <db id=/Islam>Islam</db>, <db id=/Hinduism>Hinduism</db>, <db id=/Buddhism>Buddhism</db>, <db id=/Sikhism>Sikhism</db>, and the <db id=/Bahá'í_faith>Bahá'í Faith</db>.
Jews have been present in what is now Alabama since 1763, during the colonial era of Mobile. The oldest Jewish congregation in the state is <db id=/Congregation_sha'arai_shomayim_(mobile,_alabama)>Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim</db> in Mobile. It was formally recognized by the state legislature on January 25, 1844. Jewish denominations in the state include two <db id=/Orthodox_judaism>Orthodox</db>, four <db id=/Conservative_judaism>Conservative</db>, ten <db id=/Reform_judaism_(north_america)>Reform</db>, and one <db id=/Humanistic_judaism>Humanistic</db> synagogue.
Muslim has seen a growing presence in Alabama, with 31 mosques built by 2011, with many by black converts.
There are several Hindu temples and cultural centers in the state, the most well-known being the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in <db id=/Birmingham,_alabama>Birmingham</db>, the Hindu Temple and Cultural Center Of Birmingham in <db id=/Pelham,_alabama>Pelham</db>, the Hindu Cultural Center of North Alabama in <db id=/Capshaw,_alabama>Capshaw</db>, and the Hindu Mandir and Cultural Center in <db id=/Tuscaloosa,_alabama>Tuscaloosa</db>.
There are six <db id=/Dharma_centre>Dharma centers</db> and organizations for <db id=/Theravada>Theravada</db> Buddhists. Most monastic Buddhist temples are concentrated in southern Mobile County, near <db id=/Bayou_la_batre,_alabama>Bayou La Batre</db>. This area saw an influx of refugees from <db id=/Cambodia>Cambodia</db>, <db id=/Laos>Laos</db>, and <db id=/South_vietnam>South Vietnam</db> during the 1970s and thereafter. There are four temples within a ten-mile radius of Bayou La Batre, including Chua Chanh Giac, Wat Buddharaksa, and Wat Lao Phoutthavihan.
Health.
A <db id=/Centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</db> study in 2008 showed that obesity in Alabama was a problem, with most counties having over 29% of adults obese, except for ten which had a rate between 26% and 29%. Residents of the state, along with those in five other states, were least likely in the nation to be physically active during leisure time. Alabama, and the southeastern U.S. in general, has one of the highest incidences of adult onset <db id=/Diabetes_type_ii>diabetes</db> in the country, exceeding 10% of adults.
Economy.
The state has invested in aerospace, education, health care, banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and <db id=/Fabrication_(metal)>fabrication</db>. By 2006, crop and animal production in Alabama was valued at $1.5 billion. In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about 1% of the state's <db id=/Gross_domestic_product>gross domestic product</db>. The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates. Occupations outside of agriculture were widespread by 2008. Employment in that year was 121,800 in management occupations; 71,750 in business and financial operations; 36,790 in computer-related and mathematical occupation; 44,200 in architecture and engineering; 12,410 in life, physical, and social sciences; 32,260 in community and social services; 12,770 in legal occupations; 116,250 in education, training, and library services; 27,840 in art, design and media occupations; 121,110 in healthcare; 44,750 in fire fighting, law enforcement, and security; 154,040 in food preparation and serving; 76,650 in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; 53,230 in personal care and services; 244,510 in sales; 338,760 in office and administration support; 20,510 in farming, fishing, and forestry; 120,155 in construction and mining, gas, and oil extraction; 106,280 in installation, maintenance, and repair; 224,110 in production; and 167,160 in transportation and material moving.
According to the U.S. <db id=/Bureau_of_economic_analysis>Bureau of Economic Analysis</db>, the 2008 total <db id=/Gross_state_product>gross state product</db> was $170 billion, or $29,411 per capita. Alabama's 2008 GDP increased 0.7% from the previous year. The single largest increase came in the area of information. In 2010, per capita income for the state was $22,984.
As of June 2012, the state's unemployment rate is 7.8%.
Largest employers.

The next twenty largest, as identified in the Birmingham Business Journal in 2011, included:
Agriculture.
Alabama's agricultural outputs include poultry and eggs, cattle, fish, plant nursery items, peanuts, cotton, grains such as corn and <db id=/Sorghum>sorghum</db>, vegetables, milk, <db id=/Soybean>soybeans</db>, and peaches. Although known as "The Cotton State", Alabama ranks between eighth and tenth in national cotton production, according to various reports, with Texas, <db id=/Georgia_(u.s._state)>Georgia</db> and <db id=/Mississippi>Mississippi</db> comprising the top three.
Industry.
Alabama's industrial outputs include iron and steel products (including cast-iron and steel pipe); paper, <db id=/Lumber>lumber</db>, and wood products; mining (mostly coal); plastic products; cars and trucks; and <db id=/Apparel>apparel</db>.

Marshall Space Flight Center</db> and the <db id=/United_states_army_materiel_command>U.S. Army Materiel Command</db>, headquartered at <db id=/Redstone_arsenal>Redstone Arsenal</db>.
A great deal of Alabama's economic growth since the 1990s has been due to the state's expanding automotive manufacturing industry. Located in the state are <db id=/Honda_manufacturing_of_alabama>Honda Manufacturing of Alabama</db>, <db id=/Hyundai_motor_manufacturing_alabama>Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama</db>, <db id=/Mercedes-benz_u.s._international>Mercedes-Benz U.S. International</db>, and <db id=/Toyota_motor_manufacturing_alabama>Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama</db>, as well as their various suppliers. Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state. Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation in automobile output.
Steel producers <db id=/Nucor>Nucor</db>, <db id=/Ssab>SSAB</db>, <db id=/Thyssenkrupp>ThyssenKrupp</db>, and <db id=/U.s._steel>U.S. Steel</db> have facilities in Alabama and employ over 10,000 people.

Alabama has the headquarters of <db id=/Regions_financial_corporation>Regions Financial Corporation</db>, <db id=/Bbva_compass>BBVA Compass</db>, <db id=/Superior_bancorp>Superior Bancorp</db> and the former <db id=/Colonial_bancgroup>Colonial Bancgroup</db>. Birmingham-based Compass Banchshares was acquired by Spanish-based <db id=/Bbva>BBVA</db> in September 2007, although the headquarters of BBVA Compass remains in Birmingham. In November 2006, Regions Financial completed its merger with <db id=/Amsouth_bancorporation>AmSouth Bancorporation</db>, which was also headquartered in Birmingham. <db id=/Southtrust_corporation>SouthTrust Corporation</db>, another large bank headquartered in Birmingham, was acquired by <db id=/Wachovia>Wachovia</db> in 2004 for $14.3 billion.

(Rust International was acquired in 2000 by <db id=/Washington_group_international>Washington Group International</db>, which was in turn acquired by San-Francisco based <db id=/Urs_corporation>URS Corporation</db> in 2007.)
Law and government.
State government.
The foundational document for Alabama's government is the <db id=/Alabama_constitution>Alabama Constitution</db>, which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the <db id=/U.s._constitution>U.S. Constitution</db>. There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution. This movement is based upon the fact that Alabama's constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands. Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length were intentional to codify segregation and racism.
Alabama's government is divided into three equal branches:
The <db id=/Legislative_branch>legislative branch</db> is the <db id=/Alabama_legislature>Alabama Legislature</db>, a <db id=/Bicameral>bicameral</db> assembly composed of the <db id=/Alabama_house_of_representatives>Alabama House of Representatives</db>, with 105 members, and the <db id=/Alabama_senate>Alabama Senate</db>, with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The <db id=/United_states_republican_party>Republican Party</db> currently holds a majority in both houses of the <db id=/Alabama_legislature>Legislature</db>. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).
The <db id=/Executive_branch>executive branch</db> is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the <db id=/Governor_of_alabama>Governor of Alabama</db>. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the <db id=/Attorney_general_of_alabama>Attorney General of Alabama</db>, the <db id=/Alabama_secretary_of_state>Alabama Secretary of State</db>, the <db id=/Alabama_state_treasurer>Alabama State Treasurer</db>, and the <db id=/State_auditor_of_alabama>State Auditor of Alabama</db>. The current <db id=/Governor_of_alabama>governor</db> of the state is <db id=/Republican_party_(united_states)>Republican</db> <db id=/Robert_j._bentley>Robert Bentley</db>. The <db id=/List_of_lieutenant_governors_of_alabama>lieutenant governor</db> is Republican <db id=/Kay_ivey>Kay Ivey</db>.
The <db id=/Judicial_branch>judicial branch</db> is responsible for interpreting the <db id=/Alabama_constitution>Constitution</db> and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The highest court is the <db id=/Supreme_court_of_alabama>Supreme Court of Alabama</db>. The Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican <db id=/Chuck_malone>Chuck Malone</db>. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party.
The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. The statewide officials, such as the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, and other constitutional offices take office in the following January.
Taxes.
Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent personal income tax, depending upon the amount earned and filing status. Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, and can do so even if taking the standard deduction. Taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct federal Social Security and Medicare taxes.
The state's general sales tax rate is 4%. The collection rate could be substantially higher, depending upon additional city and county sales taxes. For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay a 11% tax on a meal. Sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide. Alabama is also one of the few remaining states that levies a tax on food and medicine. Alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the nation's very highest. Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line. Alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.
The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country. <db id=/Property_tax>Property taxes</db> are the lowest in the U.S. The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.
Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670 million.
Local and county government.
Alabama has 67 <db id=/County_(united_states)>counties</db>. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the County Commission, which usually also has executive authority in the county. Because of the restraints placed in the <db id=/Alabama_constitution>Alabama Constitution</db>, all but seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no <db id=/Home_rule>home rule</db>. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.
On November 9, 2011, Jefferson County declared bankruptcy.
Alabama is an <db id=/Alcoholic_beverage_control_state>alcoholic beverage control state</db>; the government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. However, counties can declare themselves "dry"; the state does not sell alcohol in those areas.
Politics.
During <db id=/Reconstruction_era_of_the_united_states>Reconstruction</db> following the <db id=/American_civil_war>American Civil War</db>, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the <db id=/Third_military_district>Third Military District</db> under <db id=/John_pope_(military_officer)>General John Pope</db>. In 1874, the political coalition known as the <db id=/Redeemers>Redeemers</db> took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African American vote.
After 1890, a coalition of whites passed laws to <db id=/Racial_segregation>segregate</db> and disenfranchise black residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disfranchised African Americans also disfranchised poor whites, however. By 1941 more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000, although the impact was greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised.
From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state. The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972.
Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the <db id=/African-american_civil_rights_movement_(1955–1968)>American Civil Rights Movement</db>, when majority whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Democrat <db id=/George_wallace>George Wallace</db>, the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure. Only with the passage of the Federal <db id=/Civil_rights_act_of_1964>Civil Rights Act of 1964</db> and <db id=/Voting_rights_act>Voting Rights Act</db> of 1965 did <db id=/African_americans>African Americans</db> regain suffrage, among other civil rights.
In 2007, the <db id=/Alabama_legislature>Alabama Legislature</db> passed, and Republican Governor <db id=/Bob_riley>Bob Riley</db> signed a resolution expressing "profound regret" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the <db id=/Alabama_state_capitol>Alabama State Capitol</db>, which housed Congress of the <db id=/Confederate_states_of_america>Confederate States of America</db>.
In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.
Elections.
State elections.
With the disfranchisement of African Americans, the state became part of the "<db id=/Solid_south>Solid South</db>", a system in which the <db id=/Democratic_party_(united_states)>Democratic Party</db> became essentially the only political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100 years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party <db id=/Primary_election>primary</db>, with generally only token <db id=/United_states_republican_party>Republican</db> challengers running in the General Election.
Republicans hold all nine seats on the <db id=/Alabama_supreme_court>Alabama Supreme Court</db> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. This change also began, likely in part, due to the same perception by voters of Democratic party efforts to disenfranchise voters again in 1994. In that general election, the then-incumbent Chief Justice of Alabama, <db id=/Ernest_c._hornsby>Ernest C. Hornsby</db>, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican <db id=/Perry_o._hooper,_sr.>Perry O. Hooper, Sr.</db>. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.
Republicans hold all seven of the <db id=/Political_party_strength_in_alabama>statewide elected executive</db> branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the <db id=/Alabama_state_board_of_education>Alabama State Board of Education</db>. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. Democrats hold one of the three seats on the Alabama Public Service Commission.
Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since Reconstruction, one is <db id=/Kay_ivey>Kay Ivey</db>, the current Lieutenant Governor.
Local elections.
Many local offices (County Commissioners, Boards of Education, Tax Assessors, Tax Collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Local elections in most rural counties are generally decided in the Democratic primary and local elections in metropolitan and suburban counties are generally decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.
Alabama's 67 County Sheriffs are elected in partisan races and Democrats still retain the majority of those posts. The current split is 42 <db id=/Alabama_democratic_party>Democrats</db>, 24 <db id=/Alabama_republican_party>Republicans</db>, and one Independent (Choctaw). However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties and the majority of Republican sheriffs preside over more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties. Two Alabama counties (Montgomery and Calhoun) with a population of over 100,000 have Democratic sheriffs and five <db id=/Counties_of_alabama>Alabama counties</db> with a population of under 75,000 have Republican sheriffs (Autauga, Coffee, Dale, Coosa, and Blount). As of 2012, the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in <db id=/Morgan_county,_alabama>Morgan County, Alabama</db>, and nine <db id=/African_american>African American</db> sheriffs.
Federal elections.
The state's two <db id=/United_states_senate>U.S. senators</db> are <db id=/Jeff_sessions>Jefferson B. Sessions III</db> and <db id=/Richard_shelby>Richard C. Shelby</db>, both Republicans.
In the <db id=/U.s._house_of_representatives>U.S. House of Representatives</db>, the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: (<db id=/Jo_bonner>Jo Bonner</db>, <db id=/Mike_d._rogers>Mike D. Rogers</db>, <db id=/Robert_aderholt>Robert Aderholt</db>, <db id=/Morris_j._brooks>Morris J. Brooks</db>, <db id=/Martha_roby>Martha Roby</db>, and <db id=/Spencer_bachus>Spencer Bachus</db>) and one Democrat: <db id=/Terri_sewell>Terri Sewell</db>).
Education.
Primary and secondary education.
Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the overview of the <db id=/Alabama_state_board_of_education>Alabama State Board of Education</db> as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,541 individual schools provide education for 743,364 elementary and secondary students.
Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, over 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National <db id=/No_child_left_behind>No Child Left Behind</db> law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama. In 2004, 23 percent of schools met AYP.
While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data, Alabama's high school graduation rate—75%—is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi). The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.
Colleges and universities.
Alabama's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. In the state are three medical schools (<db id=/University_of_alabama_school_of_medicine>University of Alabama School of Medicine</db>, <db id=/University_of_south_alabama>University of South Alabama</db> and <db id=/Alabama_college_of_osteopathic_medicine>Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine</db>), two veterinary colleges (<db id=/Auburn_university>Auburn University</db> and <db id=/Tuskegee_university>Tuskegee University</db>), a dental school (<db id=/University_of_alabama_school_of_dentistry>University of Alabama School of Dentistry</db>), an optometry college (<db id=/University_of_alabama_at_birmingham>University of Alabama at Birmingham</db>), two pharmacy schools (<db id=/Auburn_university>Auburn University</db> and <db id=/Samford_university>Samford University</db>), and five law schools (<db id=/University_of_alabama_school_of_law>University of Alabama School of Law</db>, <db id=/Birmingham_school_of_law>Birmingham School of Law</db>, <db id=/Cumberland_school_of_law>Cumberland School of Law</db>, <db id=/Miles_law_school>Miles Law School</db>, and the <db id=/Thomas_goode_jones_school_of_law>Thomas Goode Jones School of Law</db>). Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the <db id=/Alabama_commission_on_higher_education>Alabama Commission on Higher Education</db> and the Alabama <db id=/Department_of_postsecondary_education>Department of Postsecondary Education</db>. Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year associate degrees to 16 doctoral level programs.
The largest single campus is the <db id=/University_of_alabama>University of Alabama</db>, located in <db id=/Tuscaloosa,_alabama>Tuscaloosa</db>, with 33,602 enrolled for fall 2012. <db id=/Troy_university>Troy University</db> was the largest institution in the state in 2010, with an enrollment of 29,689 students across four Alabama campuses (<db id=/Troy,_alabama>Troy</db>, <db id=/Dothan,_alabama>Dothan</db>, <db id=/Montgomery,_alabama>Montgomery</db>, and <db id=/Phenix_city,_alabama>Phenix City</db>), as well as sixty learning sites in seventeen other states and eleven other countries. The oldest institutions are the public <db id=/University_of_north_alabama>University of North Alabama</db> in <db id=/Florence,_alabama>Florence</db> and the Catholic Church-affiliated <db id=/Spring_hill_college>Spring Hill College</db> in <db id=/Mobile,_alabama>Mobile</db>, both founded in 1830.
Accreditation of academic programs is through the <db id=/Southern_association_of_colleges_and_schools>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</db> (SACS) as well as other subject-focused national and international accreditation agencies such as the <db id=/Association_for_biblical_higher_education>Association for Biblical Higher Education</db> (ABHE), the <db id=/Council_on_occupational_education>Council on Occupational Education</db> (COE), and the <db id=/Accrediting_council_for_independent_colleges_and_schools>Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools</db> (ACICS).
According to the 2011 <db id=/U.s._news_and_world_report>U.S. News and World Report</db>, Alabama had three universities ranked in the top 100 Public Schools in America (University of Alabama at 31, <db id=/Auburn_university>Auburn University</db> at 36, and <db id=/University_of_alabama_at_birmingham>University of Alabama at Birmingham</db> at 73).

Roads.
Alabama has five major interstate roads that cross the state: <db id=/I-65>I-65</db> runs north–south roughly through the middle of the state; I-59/I-20 travels from the central west border to Birmingham, where <db id=/I-59>I-59</db> continues to the north-east corner of the state and <db id=/I-20>I-20</db> continues east towards Atlanta; <db id=/I-85>I-85</db> originates in Montgomery and runs east-northeast to the Georgia border, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and <db id=/Interstate_10_in_alabama>I-10</db> traverses the southernmost portion of the state, running from west to east through Mobile. Another interstate road, <db id=/Interstate_22>I-22</db>, is currently under construction. When completed around 2014 it will connect Birmingham with <db id=/Memphis,_tennessee>Memphis, Tennessee</db>. In addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: <db id=/Interstate_165>I-165</db> in Mobile, <db id=/Interstate_359>I-359</db> in Tuscaloosa, <db id=/Interstate_459>I-459</db> around Birmingham, <db id=/Interstate_565>I-565</db> in Huntsville, and <db id=/Interstate_759>I-759</db> in Gadsden. A sixth route, <db id=/Interstate_685>I-685</db>, will be created when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery. A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will designated as <db id=/Interstate_422>I-422</db>.
Several U.S. Highways also pass through the state, such as <db id=/U.s._route_11>US 11</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_29>US 29</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_31>US 31</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_43>US 43</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_45>US 45</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_72>US 72</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_78>US 78</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_80>US 80</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_82>US 82</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_84>US 84</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_90>US 90</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_98>US 98</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_231>US 231</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_278>US 278</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_280>US 280</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_331>US 331</db>, <db id=/U.s._route_411>US 411</db>, and <db id=/U.s._route_431>US 431</db>.

Achilles

In <db id=/Greek_mythology>Greek mythology</db>, Achilles (, "Akhilleus", ) was a <db id=/Greeks>Greek</db> hero of the <db id=/Trojan_war>Trojan War</db> and the central character and greatest warrior of <db id=/Homer>Homer</db>'s "<db id=/Iliad>Iliad</db>". Achilles was a <db id=/Demigod>demigod</db>; his mother was the nymph <db id=/Thetis>Thetis</db>, and his father, <db id=/Peleus>Peleus</db>, was the king of the <db id=/Myrmidons>Myrmidons</db>.
Achilles’ most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero <db id=/Hector>Hector</db> outside the gates of <db id=/Troy>Troy</db>. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the "Iliad", other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by <db id=/Paris_(mythology)>Paris</db>, who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with a poem by <db id=/Statius>Statius</db> in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel. Because of his death from a small wound in the heel, the term "<db id=/Achilles'_heel>Achilles' heel</db>" has come to mean a person's point of weakness.
Etymology.
Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of ("akhos") "grief" and ("Laos") "a people, tribe, nation, etc." In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the "Iliad" (frequently by Achilles). Achilles' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of "kleos" (glory, usually glory in war).
"Laos" has been construed by <db id=/Gregory_nagy>Gregory Nagy</db>, following Leonard Palmer, to mean "a corps of soldiers", a <db id=/Muster_(military)>muster</db>. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: When the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.
The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC. It was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία ("Achilleía") attested in Attica in the 4th century BC (<db id=/Inscriptiones_graecae>IG</db> II² 1617) and, in the form "Achillia", on a <db id=/Female_gladiator#halicarnassus>stele in Halicarnassus</db> as the name of a female gladiator fighting an "Amazon". Roman gladiatorial games often referenced classical mythology, and this seems to reference Achilles' fight with Penthesilea but gives it an extra twist of Achilles being "played" by a woman.
Birth.
Achilles was the son of the <db id=/Nymph>nymph</db> <db id=/Thetis>Thetis</db> and <db id=/Peleus>Peleus</db>, the king of the <db id=/Myrmidons>Myrmidons</db>. <db id=/Zeus>Zeus</db> and <db id=/Poseidon>Poseidon</db> had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until <db id=/Prometheus>Prometheus</db>, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.
As with most mythology, there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in "<db id=/Argonautica>Argonautica</db>" (iv.760) Zeus' sister and wife <db id=/Hera>Hera</db> alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected him. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god <db id=/Nereus>Nereus</db>, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus.
According to the "<db id=/Achilleid>Achilleid</db>", written by <db id=/Statius>Statius</db> in the 1st century AD, and to no surviving previous sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal, by dipping him in the river <db id=/Styx>Styx</db>. However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him, his heel (see <db id=/Achilles_heel>Achilles heel</db>, <db id=/Achilles'_tendon>Achilles' tendon</db>). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in <db id=/Ambrosia>ambrosia</db> and put him on top of a fire, to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.
However, none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the "Iliad" Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the <db id=/Paeonian>Paeonian</db> hero <db id=/Asteropaeus>Asteropaeus</db>, son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, "drawing a spurt of blood".
Also, in the fragmentary poems of the <db id=/Epic_cycle>Epic Cycle</db> in which we can find description of the hero's death, "<db id=/Cypria>Cypria</db>" (unknown author), "<db id=/Aithiopis>Aithiopis</db>" by <db id=/Arctinus_of_miletus>Arctinus of Miletus</db>, "<db id=/Little_iliad>Little Iliad</db>" by Lesche of Mytilene, "<db id=/Iliou_persis>Iliou persis</db>" by <db id=/Arctinus_of_miletus>Arctinus of Miletus</db>, there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness (heel); in the later vase paintings presenting Achilles' death, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body.
Peleus entrusted Achilles to <db id=/Chiron>Chiron</db> the <db id=/Centaur>Centaur</db>, on Mt. <db id=/Pelion>Pelion</db>, to be reared.
Achilles in the Trojan War.
The first two lines of the "Iliad" read:
Achilles' consuming rage is at times wavering, but at other times he cannot be cooled. The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative.
According to the "Iliad", Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 <db id=/Myrmidons>Myrmidons</db> (Book 2). He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, Eudorus, Peisander, Phoenix and Alcimedon (Book 16).
Telephus.
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in <db id=/Mysia>Mysia</db>, ruled by King <db id=/Telephus>Telephus</db>. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that "he that wounded shall heal". Guided by the oracle, he arrived at <db id=/Argos>Argos</db>, where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy. 
According to other reports in <db id=/Euripides>Euripides</db>' lost play about Telephus, he went to <db id=/Aulis_(ancient_greece)>Aulis</db> pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held <db id=/Orestes_(mythology)>Orestes</db> for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. <db id=/Odysseus>Odysseus</db> reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed. 
Troilus.
According to the "<db id=/Cypria>Cypria</db>" (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' Wrath), when the <db id=/Achaeans_(homer)>Achaeans</db> desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of <db id=/Aeneas>Aeneas</db>, sacked neighboring cities and killed <db id=/Troilus>Troilus</db>.
According to <db id=/Dares_phrygius>Dares Phrygius</db>' "Account of the Destruction of Troy", the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, <db id=/Troilus>Troilus</db> was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King <db id=/Priam>Priam</db>'s (or sometimes <db id=/Apollo>Apollo</db>) and <db id=/Hecuba>Hecuba</db>'s five legitimate sons. Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders. Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister <db id=/Polyxena>Polyxena</db>, and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth – who refusing to yield found instead himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo. Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace. In this version of the myth, Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege. Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the <db id=/First_vatican_mythographer>First Vatican Mythographer</db> claimed Troy would have been invincible.
Achilles in the "Iliad".
Homer's "Iliad" is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles' wrath is the central theme of the book. The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by <db id=/Agamemnon>Agamemnon</db>, the commander of the <db id=/Achaeans_(homer)>Achaean</db> forces. Agamemnon had taken a woman named <db id=/Chryseis>Chryseis</db> as his slave. Her father <db id=/Chryses>Chryses</db>, a priest of <db id=/Apollo>Apollo</db>, begged Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refused and Apollo sent a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet <db id=/Calchas>Calchas</db> correctly determined the source of the troubles but would not speak unless Achilles vowed to protect him. Achilles did so and Calchas declared Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consented, but then commanded that Achilles' battle prize <db id=/Briseis>Briseis</db> be brought to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away (and as he says later, because he loved Briseis), with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refused to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At this same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles prayed to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honor.
As the battle turned against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, <db id=/Nestor_(mythology)>Nestor</db> declared that the Trojans were winning because Agamemnon had angered Achilles, and urged the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agreed and sent <db id=/Odysseus>Odysseus</db> and two other chieftains, <db id=/Ajax_(mythology)>Ajax</db> and <db id=/Phoenix_(son_of_amyntor)>Phoenix</db>, to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejected all Agamemnon offered him, and simply urged the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.
The Trojans, led by <db id=/Hector>Hector</db>, subsequently pushed the Greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, <db id=/Patroclus>Patroclus</db> led the <db id=/Myrmidons>Myrmidons</db> into battle wearing Achilles' armor, though Achilles remained at his camp. Patroclus succeeded in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but was killed by Hector before he could lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.
After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from <db id=/Antilochus>Antilochus</db>, the son of Nestor, Achilles grieved over his beloved companion's death and held many funeral games in his honor. His mother Thetis came to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuaded <db id=/Hephaestus>Hephaestus</db> to make a new armor for him, in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by Hector. The new armor included the <db id=/Shield_of_achilles>Shield of Achilles</db>, described in great detail by the poet.
Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ended his refusal to fight and took the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engaged in battle with the river god <db id=/Scamander>Scamander</db> who became angry that Achilles was choking his waters with all the men he killed. The god tried to drown Achilles but was stopped by <db id=/Hera>Hera</db> and Hephaestus. Zeus himself took note of Achilles' rage and sent the gods to restrain him so that he would not go on to sack Troy itself, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles could defy fate itself as Troy was not meant to be destroyed yet. Finally, Achilles found his prey. Achilles chased Hector around the wall of Troy three times before <db id=/Athena>Athena</db>, in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, <db id=/Deiphobus>Deiphobus</db>, persuaded Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realized the trick, he knew the battle was inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charged at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but missed. Accepting his fate, Hector begged Achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles told Hector it was hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that "my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me". Achilles then got his vengeance.
With the assistance of the god <db id=/Hermes>Hermes</db>, Hector's father, <db id=/Priam>Priam</db>, went to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles to permit him to perform for Hector his funeral rites. Achilles relented and promised a truce for the duration of Hector's funeral. The final passage in the "Iliad" is Hector's funeral, after which the doom of Troy was just a matter of time.
Penthesilea.
Achilles, after his temporary truce with Priam, fought and killed the <db id=/Amazons>Amazonian</db> warrior queen <db id=/Penthesilea>Penthesilea</db>, but later grieved over her death. At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her. As he grieved over the death of such a rare beauty, a notorious Greek jeerer by the name of <db id=/Thersites>Thersites</db> laughed and mocked the great Achilles.
Memnon, and the fall of Achilles.
Following the death of Patroclus, Achilles' closest companion was Nestor's son <db id=/Antilochus>Antilochus</db>. When <db id=/Memnon_(mythology)>Memnon</db>, king of <db id=/Ethiopia_(mythology)>Ethiopia</db> slew Antilochus, Achilles once more obtained revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.
Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the "Iliad"'s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the <db id=/Epic_cycle>cyclic epic</db> "<db id=/Aethiopis>Aethiopis</db>", which was composed after the "Iliad", possibly in the 7th century B.C. The "Aethiopis" is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.
The death of Achilles, as predicted by <db id=/Hector>Hector</db> with his dying breath, was brought about by <db id=/Paris_(mythology)>Paris</db> with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions, the god <db id=/Apollo>Apollo</db> guided Paris' arrow. Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow.
All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valor, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of <db id=/Patroclus>Patroclus</db>, and funeral games were held. He was represented in the "Aethiopis" as living after his death in the island of <db id=/Leuke>Leuke</db> at the mouth of the river <db id=/Danube>Danube</db>.
Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, <db id=/Polyxena>Polyxena</db>. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him.
Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus.
Paris was later killed by <db id=/Philoctetes>Philoctetes</db> using the enormous bow of <db id=/Heracles>Heracles</db>.
Fate of Achilles' armor.
Achilles' armor was the object of a feud between <db id=/Odysseus>Odysseus</db> and <db id=/Ajax_(mythology)>Telamonian Ajax</db> (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of Odysseus. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned the ire of Athena. Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armor to <db id=/Neoptolemus>Neoptolemus</db>, the son of Achilles.
A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of <db id=/Phaselis>Phaselis</db>, Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by <db id=/Alexander_the_great>Alexander the Great</db>, who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the "Iliad" with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear, which he would indeed have touched with excitement. But it was being shown in the time of <db id=/Pausanias_(geographer)>Pausanias</db> in the 2nd century AD.
Achilles and Patroclus.
The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the "Iliad", it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship, but commentators from <db id=/Classical_antiquity>classical antiquity</db> to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the <db id=/Pederasty_in_ancient_greece>Greek custom of "paiderasteia"</db>. In Plato's "Symposium", the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover. But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish <db id=/Heterosexual>heterosexual</db> and <db id=/Homosexual>homosexual</db>, and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women. Although epic decorum excluded explicit sexuality, the "Iliad" indicates that Achilles had sexual relations with women, with no direct evidence of sexual behaviors with Patroclus.
Worship of Achilles in antiquity.
There was an archaic <db id=/Heroic_cult>heroic cult</db> of Achilles on the <db id=/Snake_island_(black_sea)>White Island, "Leuce"</db>, in the <db id=/Black_sea>Black Sea</db> off the modern coasts of <db id=/Romania>Romania</db> and <db id=/Ukraine>Ukraine</db>, with a temple and an <db id=/Oracle>oracle</db> which survived into the Roman period.
In the lost epic " <db id=/Aithiopis>Aithiopis</db>", a continuation of the "Iliad" attributed to <db id=/Arctinus>Arktinus of Miletos</db>, Achilles’ mother Thetis returned to mourn him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube. There the Achaeans raised a <db id=/Tumulus>tumulus</db> for him and celebrated funeral games.
<db id=/Pliny_the_elder>Pliny's</db> <db id=/Natural_history_(pliny)>"Natural History"</db> mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident ("Insula Akchillis tumulo eius viri clara"), on the island consecrated to him, located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from <db id=/Peuce>Peuce</db> by the <db id=/Danube_delta>Danube Delta</db>, and the temple there. <db id=/Pausanias_(geographer)>Pausanias</db> has been told that the island is "covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles’ temple and his statue". Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823, but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island.
<db id=/Pomponius_mela>Pomponius Mela</db> tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea, between Boristhene and Ister. The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia, who lived at the time of Domitian, writes that the island was called "Leuce" "because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor".
The "<db id=/Periplus_ponti_euxini>Periplus of the Euxine Sea</db>" gives the following details: "It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus’ honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles’ temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles’ honor. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles’ oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn’t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships". (quoted in Densuşianu)
The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity, not only along the sea lanes of the <db id=/Black_sea>Pontic Sea</db> but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea.
Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as "Pontarches" the lord and master of the Pontic Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation. Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice. To Achilles of Leuce were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters: Achilleion in Messenia (<db id=/Stephanus_byzantinus>Stephanus Byzantinus</db>), Achilleios in Laconia (<db id=/Pausanias_(geographer)>Pausanias</db>, III.25,4) <db id=/Nicolae_densuşianu>Nicolae Densuşianu</db> (Densuşianu 1913) even though he recognized Achilles in the name of <db id=/Aquileia>Aquileia</db> and in the north arm of the Danube delta, the arm of Chilia ("Achileii"), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law."
Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias (III.19,13) reports that the <db id=/Delphi>Delphic Pythia</db> sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound. <db id=/Ammianus_marcellinus>Ammianus Marcellinus</db> (XXII.8) attributes the healing to waters ("aquae") on the island.
Worship of Achilles in modern times: The Achilleion in Corfu.
In the region of Gastouri (Γαστούρι) to the south of the city of <db id=/Corfu>Corfu</db> Greece, Empress of Austria <db id=/Elisabeth_of_bavaria>Elisabeth of Bavaria</db> also known as Sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with Achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to <db id=/Platonism>platonic</db> <db id=/Romanticism>romanticism</db>. The palace, naturally, was named after Achilles: "<db id=/Achilleion_(corfu)>Achilleion</db>" (Αχίλλειον). This elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the <db id=/Trojan_war>Trojan war</db>.
Other stories.
Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hides the young man at the court of <db id=/Lycomedes>Lycomedes</db>, king of <db id=/Skyros>Skyros</db>. There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name "Pyrrha" (the red-haired girl). With Lycomedes' daughter <db id=/Deidamia_(mythology)>Deidamia</db>, whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, <db id=/Neoptolemus>Neoptolemus</db> (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias). According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet <db id=/Calchas>Calchas</db> that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid. Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.
In book 11 of Homer's "<db id=/Odyssey>Odyssey</db>", Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as "blessed in life, blessed in death", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction. This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life. Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the <db id=/Greek_colonies>Greek colonies</db> on the Black Sea, the location of the mythical "White Island" which he was said to inhabit after his death, together with many other heroes.
The kings of the <db id=/Despotate_of_epirus>Epirus</db> claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, Neoptolemus. <db id=/Alexander_the_great>Alexander the Great</db>, son of the Epirote princess <db id=/Olympias>Olympias</db>, could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at <db id=/Achilleion_(troad)#tomb_of_achilles>Achilleion</db> while passing Troy. In AD 216 the Roman Emperor <db id=/Caracalla>Caracalla</db>, while on his way to war against <db id=/Parthia>Parthia</db>, emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles' tumulus.
Achilles fought and killed the <db id=/Amazons>Amazon</db> <db id=/Helene_(amazon)>Helene</db>. Some also said he married <db id=/Medea>Medea</db>, and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades – as Hera promised Thetis in <db id=/Apollonius_of_rhodes>Apollonius</db>' "<db id=/Argonautica>Argonautica</db>". In some versions of the myth, Achilles has a relationship with his captive <db id=/Briseis>Briseis</db>.
Achilles in Greek tragedy.
The <db id=/Tragedy>Greek tragedian</db> <db id=/Aeschylus>Aeschylus</db> wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title "Achilleis" by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of <db id=/Hector>Hector</db> and eventual death when an arrow shot by <db id=/Paris_(mythology)>Paris</db> and guided by <db id=/Apollo>Apollo</db> punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the "Achilleis" and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the "Achilleis" trilogy, "The Myrmidons", focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today. In Plato's "Symposium", Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.

Abraham Lincoln

Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the <db id=/List_of_presidents_of_the_united_states>16th President of the United States</db>, serving from March 1861 until <db id=/Assassination_of_abraham_lincoln>his assassination in April 1865</db>. Lincoln led the United States through its greatest constitutional, military, and moral crises—the <db id=/American_civil_war>American Civil War</db>—preserving the <db id=/Union_(american_civil_war)>Union</db>, abolishing slavery, strengthening the national government and modernizing the economy. Reared in a poor family on the <db id=/American_frontier>western frontier</db>, Lincoln was self-educated, and became a country lawyer, a <db id=/Whig_party_(united_states)>Whig Party leader</db>, <db id=/Illinois_house_of_representatives>Illinois state legislator</db> during the 1830s, and a one-term member of the <db id=/United_states_house_of_representatives>United States House of Representatives</db> during the 1840s.
After a <db id=/Lincoln–douglas_debates>series of debates</db> in 1858 that gave national visibility to his opposition to the expansion of slavery, Lincoln lost a Senate race to his arch-rival, <db id=/Stephen_a._douglas>Stephen A. Douglas</db>. Lincoln, a moderate from a swing state, secured the <db id=/Republican_party_(united_states)>Republican Party</db> presidential nomination in 1860. With almost no support in the <db id=/Southern_united_states>South</db>, Lincoln swept the <db id=/Northern_united_states>North</db> and was <db id=/United_states_presidential_election,_1860>elected president in 1860</db>. His election was the signal for seven southern slave states to declare their <db id=/Secession_in_the_united_states>secession from the Union</db> and form the <db id=/Confederate_states_of_america>Confederacy</db>. The departure of the Southerners gave Lincoln's party firm control of Congress, but no formula for compromise or reconciliation was found. Lincoln explained in his <db id=/Lincoln's_second_inaugural_address>second inaugural address</db>: "Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came."
When the North enthusiastically rallied behind the national flag after the Confederate attack on <db id=/Fort_sumter>Fort Sumter</db> on April 12, 1861, Lincoln concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war effort. His goal was now to reunite the nation. As the South was in a state of insurrection, Lincoln exercised his authority to suspend "<db id=/Habeas_corpus>habeas corpus</db>", arresting and temporarily detaining thousands of suspected secessionists without trial. Lincoln averted British recognition of the Confederacy by skillfully handling the <db id=/Trent_affair>"Trent" affair</db> in late 1861. His efforts toward the <db id=/Abolitionism>abolition</db> of slavery include issuing his <db id=/Emancipation_proclamation>Emancipation Proclamation</db> in 1863, encouraging the border states to outlaw slavery, and helping push through Congress the <db id=/Thirteenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution>Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</db>, which finally freed all the slaves nationwide in December 1865. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including commanding general <db id=/Ulysses_s._grant>Ulysses S. Grant</db>. Lincoln brought leaders of the major factions of his party into his cabinet and pressured them to cooperate. Under Lincoln's leadership, the Union set up a naval blockade that shut down the South's normal trade, took control of the <db id=/Border_states_(american_civil_war)>border slave states</db> at the start of the war, gained control of communications with gunboats on the southern river systems, and tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at <db id=/Richmond,_virginia>Richmond, Virginia</db>. Each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another until finally Grant succeeded in 1865.
An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to <db id=/War_democrats>War Democrats</db> and managed his own re-election in the <db id=/United_states_presidential_election,_1864>1864 presidential election</db>. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party, Lincoln found his policies and personality were "blasted from all sides": <db id=/Radical_republicans>Radical Republicans</db> demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats desired more compromise, <db id=/Copperhead_(politics)>Copperheads</db> despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists plotted his death. Politically, Lincoln fought back with patronage, by pitting his opponents against each other, and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory. His <db id=/Gettysburg_address>Gettysburg Address</db> of 1863 became the most quoted speech in American history. It was an iconic statement of America's dedication to the principles of nationalism, <db id=/Republicanism_in_the_united_states>republicanism</db>, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of <db id=/Reconstruction_era_of_the_united_states>Reconstruction</db>, seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. Six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general <db id=/Robert_e._lee>Robert E. Lee</db>, however, Lincoln was <db id=/Assassination_of_abraham_lincoln>assassinated</db> by actor and Confederate sympathizer <db id=/John_wilkes_booth>John Wilkes Booth</db>. Lincoln's death was the first assassination of a U.S. president and sent the nation into <db id=/Funeral_and_burial_of_abraham_lincoln>mourning</db>. Lincoln has been consistently <db id=/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_united_states#scholar_survey_results>ranked</db> by scholars and the public as one of the three greatest U.S. presidents, the others by scholars being <db id=/George_washington>George Washington</db> and <db id=/Franklin_d._roosevelt>Franklin D. Roosevelt</db>, and by the public, <db id=/Ronald_reagan>Ronald Reagan</db> and <db id=/Bill_clinton>Bill Clinton</db>.
Family and childhood.
Early life.
Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809, the second child of <db id=/Thomas_lincoln>Thomas Lincoln</db> and <db id=/Nancy_lincoln>Nancy Lincoln</db> (née Hanks), in a one-room log cabin on the <db id=/Sinking_spring_farm>Sinking Spring Farm</db> in <db id=/Hardin_county,_kentucky>Hardin County</db>, Kentucky (now <db id=/Larue_county,_kentucky>LaRue County</db>). He is descended from <db id=/Samuel_lincoln>Samuel Lincoln</db>, who arrived in <db id=/Hingham,_massachusetts>Hingham</db>, Massachusetts, from <db id=/Norfolk>Norfolk</db>, <db id=/England>England</db>, in the 17th century. Lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake, <db id=/Abraham_lincoln_(captain)>Abraham</db>, had moved his family from Virginia to Kentucky, where he was ambushed and killed in an Indian raid in 1786, with his children, including Lincoln's father Thomas, looking on. Thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier. Lincoln's mother, Nancy, was the daughter of Lucy Hanks, and was born in what is now <db id=/Mineral_county,_west_virginia>Mineral County</db>, West Virginia, then part of Virginia. Lucy moved with Nancy to Kentucky. Nancy Hanks married Thomas, who became a respected citizen. He bought and sold several farms, including <db id=/Knob_creek_farm>Knob Creek Farm</db>. The family attended a <db id=/Separate_baptists>Separate Baptists</db> church, which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery. Thomas enjoyed considerable status in Kentucky—where he sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners. By the time his son Abraham was born, Thomas owned two farms, several town lots, livestock, and horses. He was among the richest men in the county. However, in 1816, Thomas lost all of his land in court cases because of faulty property titles.
The family <db id=/Lincoln_boyhood_national_memorial>moved north across the Ohio River</db> to free (i.e., non-slave) territory and made a new start in what was then <db id=/Perry_county,_indiana#history>Perry County</db> but is now <db id=/Spencer_county,_indiana>Spencer County, Indiana</db>. Lincoln later noted that this move was "partly on account of slavery" but mainly due to land title difficulties. In Indiana, when Lincoln was nine, his mother Nancy died of <db id=/Milk_sickness>milk sickness</db> in 1818. After the death of Lincoln's mother, his older sister, <db id=/Sarah_lincoln_grigsby>Sarah</db>, took charge of caring for him until their father remarried in 1819; Sarah later died in her 20s while giving birth to a stillborn son.
Thomas Lincoln's new wife was the widow <db id=/Sarah_bush_lincoln>Sarah Bush Johnston</db>, the mother of three children. Lincoln became very close to his stepmother, and referred to her as "Mother". As a pre-teen, he did not like the hard labor associated with frontier life. Some in his family, and in the neighborhood, for a time considered him to be lazy. As he grew into his teens, he willingly took responsibility for all chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household and became an adept axeman in his work building rail fences. He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match to which he was challenged by the renowned leader of a group of ruffians, "the Clary's Grove boys". Lincoln also agreed with the customary obligation of a son to give his father all earnings from work done outside the home until age 21. In later years, Lincoln occasionally loaned his father money. Lincoln became increasingly distant from his father, in part because of his father's lack of education. While young Lincoln's formal education consisted approximately of a year's worth of classes from several itinerant teachers, he was mostly self-educated and was an avid reader and often sought access to any new books in the village. He read and reread the "<db id=/King_james_bible>King James Bible</db>," <db id=/Aesop>Aesop</db>'s "Fables," <db id=/John_bunyan>Bunyan</db>'s "Pilgrim's Progress," <db id=/Daniel_defoe>Defoe</db>'s "Robinson Crusoe," and <db id=/Benjamin_franklin>Franklin</db>'s "Autobiography."
In 1830, fearing a milk sickness outbreak along the Ohio River, the Lincoln family moved west, where they settled on public land in <db id=/Macon_county,_illinois>Macon County</db>, Illinois, another free, non-slave state. In 1831, Thomas relocated the family to a <db id=/Lincoln_log_cabin_state_historic_site>new homestead</db> in <db id=/Coles_county,_illinois>Coles County</db>, Illinois. It was then that, as an ambitious 22-year-old who was now old enough to make his own decisions, Lincoln struck out on his own. Canoeing down the <db id=/Sangamon_river>Sangamon River</db>, Lincoln ended up in the village of <db id=/New_salem,_menard_county,_illinois>New Salem</db> in <db id=/Sangamon_county,_illinois>Sangamon County</db>. In the spring of 1831, hired by New Salem businessman <db id=/Denton_offutt>Denton Offutt</db> and accompanied by friends, he took goods by <db id=/Flatboat>flatboat</db> from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon, Illinois, and Mississippi rivers. After arriving in New Orleans—and witnessing slavery firsthand—he walked back home.
Marriage and children.
Lincoln's first romantic interest was <db id=/Ann_rutledge>Ann Rutledge</db>, whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged. She died at the age of 22 on August 25, 1835, most likely of <db id=/Typhoid_fever>typhoid fever</db>. In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister. Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem. Mary did return in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. She never replied and the courtship ended.
In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to <db id=/Mary_todd_lincoln>Mary Todd</db>, who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in <db id=/Lexington,_kentucky>Lexington</db>, Kentucky. They met in <db id=/Springfield,_illinois>Springfield</db>, Illinois, in December 1839 and were engaged the following December.
A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln's initiative. They later met again at a party and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister. While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, "To hell, I suppose."
In 1844, the couple bought <db id=/Lincoln_home_national_historic_site>a house</db> in Springfield near Lincoln's law office. Mary Todd Lincoln kept house, often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl. <db id=/Robert_todd_lincoln>Robert Todd Lincoln</db> was born in 1843 and <db id=/Edward_baker_lincoln>Edward Baker Lincoln</db> (Eddie) in 1846. Lincoln "was remarkably fond of children", and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their children. Edward died on February 1, 1850, in Springfield, probably of tuberculosis. <db id=/William_wallace_lincoln>"Willie" Lincoln</db> was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862. The Lincolns' fourth son, <db id=/Tad_lincoln>Thomas "Tad" Lincoln</db>, was born on April 4, 1853, and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16, 1871. Robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children. His last descendant, grandson <db id=/Robert_todd_lincoln_beckwith>Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith</db>, died in 1985.
The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents. Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875. Abraham Lincoln suffered from "<db id=/Melancholy>melancholy</db>", a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression.
Lincoln's father-in-law was based in Lexington, Kentucky; he and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders. Lincoln was close to the Todds, and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington. He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children.
Early career and militia service.
In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in <db id=/Lincoln's_new_salem>New Salem</db>, Illinois. Although the economy was booming in the region, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the <db id=/Illinois_general_assembly>Illinois General Assembly</db>. He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.
Before the election, Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the <db id=/Black_hawk_war>Black Hawk War</db>. Following his return, Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly. At , he was tall and "strong enough to intimidate any rival". At his first speech, when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked, Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his "neck and the seat of his trousers" and threw him. Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.
Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, all the while reading voraciously. He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading <db id=/William_blackstone>Blackstone</db>'s "<db id=/Commentaries_on_the_laws_of_england>Commentaries on the Laws of England</db>" and other law books. Of his learning method, Lincoln stated: "I studied with nobody". His second campaign in 1834 was successful. He won election to the state legislature; though he ran as a <db id=/Whig_party_(united_states)>Whig</db>, many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent. <db id=/Admission_to_the_bar_in_the_united_states>Admitted to the bar</db> in 1836, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, and began to practice law under <db id=/John_t._stuart>John T. Stuart</db>, Mary Todd's cousin. Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments. He partnered with <db id=/Stephen_t._logan>Stephen T. Logan</db> from 1841 until 1844, when he began his practice with <db id=/William_herndon_(lawyer)>William Herndon</db>, whom Lincoln thought "a studious young man". He served four successive terms in the <db id=/Illinois_house_of_representatives>Illinois House of Representatives</db> as a Whig representative from Sangamon County.
In the 1835–36 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage to white males, whether landowners or not. He was known for his "free soil" stance of opposing both slavery and <db id=/Abolitionism>abolitionism</db>. He first articulated this in 1837, saying, " Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils." He closely followed <db id=/Henry_clay>Henry Clay</db> in supporting the <db id=/American_colonization_society>American Colonization Society</db> program of making the abolition of slavery practical by helping the freed slaves to settle in <db id=/Liberia>Liberia</db> in Africa.
Congressman Lincoln.
From the early 1830s, Lincoln was a steadfast <db id=/Whig_party_(united_states)>Whig</db> and professed to friends in 1861 to be, "an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay". The party, including Lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, protective tariffs to fund <db id=/Internal_improvements>internal improvements</db> including railroads, and espoused urbanization as well.
In 1846, Lincoln was elected to the <db id=/United_states_house_of_representatives>U.S. House of Representatives</db>, where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line. Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman <db id=/Joshua_r._giddings>Joshua R. Giddings</db>, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the <db id=/Washington,_district_of_columbia>District of Columbia</db> with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters. On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke out against the <db id=/Mexican–american_war>Mexican–American War</db>, which he attributed to <db id=/James_k._polk>President Polk</db>'s desire for "military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood". Lincoln also supported the <db id=/Wilmot_proviso>Wilmot Proviso</db>, which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.
Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his <db id=/Spot_resolutions>Spot Resolutions</db>. The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U.S.; Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had "invaded "our territory" and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our "own soil"". Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil. Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it, the national papers ignored it, and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him "spotty Lincoln". Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers.
Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, Lincoln, who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House, supported General <db id=/Zachary_taylor>Zachary Taylor</db> for the Whig nomination in the <db id=/United_states_presidential_election,_1848>1848 presidential election</db>. Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the <db id=/General_land_office>General Land Office</db>, but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival, <db id=/Justin_butterfield>Justin Butterfield</db>, considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer, but in Lincoln's view, an "old fossil". The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the <db id=/Oregon_territory>Oregon Territory</db>. This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.
Prairie lawyer.
Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield, handling "every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer". Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session. Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him. His reputation grew, and he appeared before the <db id=/Supreme_court_of_the_united_states>Supreme Court of the United States</db>, arguing a case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. In 1849, he received <db id=/Abraham_lincoln's_patent>a patent for a flotation device</db> for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.
In 1851, he represented the <db id=/Alton_railroad>Alton & Sangamon Railroad</db> in a dispute with one of its shareholders, James A. Barret, who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route. Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter in existence at the time of Barret's pledge; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer, superior, and less expensive route, and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret's payment. The decision by the <db id=/Supreme_court_of_illinois>Illinois Supreme Court</db> has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation. Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor. From 1853 to 1860, another of Lincoln's largest clients was the <db id=/Illinois_central_railroad>Illinois Central Railroad</db>.
Lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended <db id=/William_"duff"_armstrong>William "Duff" Armstrong</db>, who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker. The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by <db id=/Judicial_notice>judicial notice</db> in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a "<db id=/Farmers'_almanac>Farmers' Almanac</db>" showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Based on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted. Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, who was accused of stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.
Republican politics 1854–60.
Slavery and a "House Divided".
By the 1850s, slavery was still legal in the southern United States, but had been generally outlawed in the northern states, such as Illinois. Lincoln disapproved of slavery, and the spread of slavery to new U.S. territory in the west. He returned to politics to oppose the pro-slavery <db id=/Kansas–nebraska_act>Kansas–Nebraska Act</db> (1854); this law repealed the slavery-restricting <db id=/Missouri_compromise>Missouri Compromise</db> (1820). Senior Senator <db id=/Stephen_a._douglas>Stephen A. Douglas</db> of Illinois had incorporated <db id=/Popular_sovereignty_in_the_united_states#emergence_of_the_term_"popular_sovereignty"_and_its_pejorative_connotation>popular sovereignty</db> into the Act. Douglas' provision, which Lincoln opposed, specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new U.S. territory, rather than have such a decision restricted by the national Congress. <db id=/Eric_foner>Eric Foner</db> (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the <db id=/Republicanism_in_the_united_states>republicanism principles</db> of the <db id=/Founding_fathers>Founding Fathers</db>, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the <db id=/Declaration_of_independence>Declaration of Independence</db>.
On October 16, 1854, in his "<db id=/Abraham_lincoln_peoria_speech>Peoria Speech</db>", Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency. Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice, he said the Kansas Act had a ""declared" indifference, but as I must think, a covert "real" zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world ..."
In late 1854, Lincoln ran as a Whig for the U.S. Senate seat from Illinois. At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature. After leading in the first six rounds of voting in the Illinois assembly, his support began to dwindle, and Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for <db id=/Lyman_trumbull>Lyman Trumbull</db>, who defeated opponent <db id=/Joel_aldrich_matteson>Joel Aldrich Matteson</db>. The Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Lincoln wrote, "I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist, even though I do no more than oppose the "extension" of slavery." Drawing on remnants of the old Whig party, and on disenchanted <db id=/Free_soil_party>Free Soil</db>, <db id=/Liberty_party_(united_states,_1840)>Liberty</db>, and <db id=/Democratic_party_(united_states)>Democratic Party</db> members, he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new <db id=/Republican_party_(united_states)>Republican Party</db>. At the <db id=/1856_republican_national_convention>1856 Republican National Convention</db>, Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party's candidate for vice president.
In 1857–1858, Douglas broke with President <db id=/James_buchanan>James Buchanan</db>, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the <db id=/Lecompton_constitution>Lecompton Constitution</db>, which would have admitted Kansas as a <db id=/Slave_state>slave state</db>. In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued its decision in "<db id=/Dred_scott_v._sandford>Dred Scott v. Sandford</db>"; Chief Justice <db id=/Roger_b._taney>Roger B. Taney</db> opined that blacks were not citizens, and derived no rights from the Constitution. Lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the <db id=/Slave_power>Slave Power</db>. Lincoln argued, "The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'."
After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U.S. Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his <db id=/Lincoln's_house_divided_speech>House Divided Speech</db>, drawing on : "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other." The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North. The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator.
Lincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech.
The Senate campaign featured the seven <db id=/Lincoln–douglas_debates>Lincoln–Douglas debates</db> of 1858, the most famous political debates in American history. The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that "<db id=/The_slave_power>The Slave Power</db>" was threatening the values of <db id=/Republicanism_in_the_united_states>republicanism</db>, and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that <db id=/All_men_are_created_equal>all men are created equal</db>, while Douglas emphasized his <db id=/Freeport_doctrine>Freeport Doctrine</db>, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' <db id=/Popular_sovereignty>popular sovereignty</db> theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the "Dred Scott" decision.
Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation. In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the "Illinois Staats-Anzeiger," a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize.
On February 27, 1860, New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a <db id=/Cooper_union_speech>speech at Cooper Union</db> to a group of powerful Republicans. Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery, and rejected any "groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong". Despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly—Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination. Journalist <db id=/Noah_brooks>Noah Brooks</db> reported, "No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience." Historian <db id=/David_herbert_donald>Donald</db> described the speech as a "superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's (<db id=/William_h._seward>William H. Seward</db>) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (<db id=/Salmon_p._chase>Salmon P. Chase</db>) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery." In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions, Lincoln said, "The taste "is" in my mouth a little."
1860 Presidential nomination and campaign.
On May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in <db id=/Decatur,_illinois>Decatur</db>. Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by <db id=/David_davis_(supreme_court_justice)>David Davis</db>, <db id=/Norman_b._judd>Norman Judd</db>, <db id=/Leonard_swett>Leonard Swett</db>, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency. Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father, Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of "The Rail Candidate". On May 18, at the <db id=/1860_republican_national_convention>Republican National Convention</db> in Chicago, Lincoln's friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. A former Democrat, <db id=/Hannibal_hamlin>Hannibal Hamlin</db> of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff. On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top. Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs. Lincoln's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others, while following Lincoln's strong dictate to "Make no contracts that bind me".
Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party, as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the "Dred Scott" decision and the presidency of James Buchanan. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. Meanwhile, Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats. Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the <db id=/1860_democratic_national_convention>Democratic convention</db>, disagreeing with Douglas' position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected <db id=/John_c._breckinridge>John C. Breckinridge</db> as their candidate.
As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns, Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches. Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of "free labor", whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a "Chicago Tribune" writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies.
Presidency.
1860 election and secession.
On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and <db id=/John_bell_(tennessee_politician)>John Bell</db> of the new <db id=/Constitutional_union_party_(united_states)>Constitutional Union Party</db>. He was the first president from the Republican Party. Winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North and West, no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states. Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, Douglas 1,376,957 votes, Breckinridge 849,781 votes, and Bell 588,789 votes. Turnout was 82.2 percent, with Lincoln winning the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon. Douglas won Missouri, and split New Jersey with Lincoln. Bell won Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and Breckinridge won the rest of the South. Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote, his victory in the <db id=/United_states_electoral_college>electoral college</db> was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were <db id=/Electoral_fusion>fusion tickets</db> in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.
As Lincoln's election became evident, secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March. On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed. Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the <db id=/Confederate_states_of_america>Confederate States of America</db>. The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal. The Confederacy selected <db id=/Jefferson_davis>Jefferson Davis</db> as its provisional President on February 9, 1861.
There were attempts at compromise. The <db id=/Crittenden_compromise>Crittenden Compromise</db> would have extended the <db id=/Missouri_compromise>Missouri Compromise</db> line of 1820, dividing the territories into slave and free, contrary to the Republican Party's free-soil platform. Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, "I will suffer death before I consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right." Lincoln, however, did tacitly support the proposed <db id=/Corwin_amendment>Corwin Amendment</db> to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states. That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent. A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution. Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution.
En route to his inauguration by train, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North. The president-elect then <db id=/Baltimore_plot>evaded possible assassins</db> in Baltimore, who were uncovered by Lincoln's head of security, <db id=/Allan_pinkerton>Allan Pinkerton</db>. On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard. Lincoln directed his <db id=/Lincoln's_first_inaugural_address>inaugural address</db> to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the Southern states:
The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: "We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies ... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature." The failure of the <db id=/Peace_conference_of_1861>Peace Conference of 1861</db> signaled that legislative compromise was implausible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated.
Beginning of the war.
The commander of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, <db id=/Robert_anderson_(civil_war)>Major Robert Anderson</db>, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at <db id=/Battle_of_fort_sumter>Fort Sumter</db>, forcing them to surrender, and began the war. Historian <db id=/Allan_nevins>Allan Nevins</db> argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion. <db id=/William_tecumseh_sherman>William Tecumseh Sherman</db> talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was "sadly disappointed" at his failure to realize that "the country was sleeping on a volcano" and that the South was preparing for war. Donald concludes that, "His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that."
On April 15, Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and "preserve the Union", which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. This call forced the states to choose sides. Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital, despite the exposed position of <db id=/Richmond,_virginia>Richmond</db> so close to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral.
Troops headed south towards Washington to protect the capital in response to Lincoln's call. On April 19, secessionist mobs in Baltimore that controlled the rail links <db id=/Baltimore_riot_of_1861>attacked Union troops</db> traveling to the capital. <db id=/George_william_brown>George William Brown</db>, the Mayor of Baltimore, and other suspected Maryland politicians were arrested and imprisoned, without a warrant, as Lincoln suspended the writ of "<db id=/Habeas_corpus_in_the_united_states#suspension_during_the_civil_war>habeas corpus</db>". <db id=/John_merryman>John Merryman</db>, a leader in the secessionist group in Maryland, petitioned Chief Justice <db id=/Roger_b._taney>Roger B. Taney</db> to issue a writ of "habeas corpus," saying holding Merryman without a hearing was unlawful. Taney issued the writ, thereby ordering Merryman's release, but Lincoln ignored it. Then and throughout the war, Lincoln came under heavy, often attack from antiwar Democrats, called <db id=/Copperhead_(politics)>Copperheads</db>.
Assuming command for the Union in the war.
After the fall of <db id=/Battle_of_fort_sumter>Fort Sumter</db>, Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as <db id=/Commander-in-chief>commander-in-chief</db>, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending "habeas corpus", arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.
The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the <db id=/Confiscation_act_of_1861>Confiscation Act</db> that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy
In late August 1861, General <db id=/John_c._frémont>John C. Frémont</db>, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without consulting Washington, a proclamation of <db id=/Martial_law>martial law</db> in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be <db id=/Court-martial>court-martialed</db> and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the <db id=/Department_of_the_west>Department of the West</db> compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal. Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.
The <db id=/Trent_affair>Trent Affair</db> of late 1861 threatened war with <db id=/Great_britain>Great Britain</db>. The U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British merchant ship, the "Trent", on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with Britain. Lincoln's foreign policy approach had been initially hands off, due to his inexperience; he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward. Seward's initial reaction to the "Trent" affair, however, was too bellicose, so Lincoln also turned to Senator <db id=/Charles_sumner>Charles Sumner</db>, the chairman of the <db id=/Senate_foreign_relations_committee>Senate Foreign Relations Committee</db> and an expert in British diplomacy.
To learn technical military terms, Lincoln borrowed and studied <db id=/Henry_halleck>Henry Halleck</db>'s book, "Elements of Military Art and Science" from the <db id=/Library_of_congress>Library of Congress</db>. Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the <db id=/United_states_war_department>War Department</db> in Washington, D.C. He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party). In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced <db id=/Simon_cameron>Simon Cameron</db> with <db id=/Edwin_stanton>Edwin Stanton</db> as <db id=/United_states_secretary_of_war>War Secretary</db>. Stanton was one of many conservative Democrats (he supported Breckenridge in the 1860 election) who became anti-slavery Republicans under Lincoln's leadership. In terms of war strategy, Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days. Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard. Lincoln learned from his chief of staff General <db id=/Henry_wager_halleck>Henry Halleck</db>, a student of the European strategist <db id=/Antoine-henri_jomini>Jomini</db>, of the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River; he also knew well the importance of <db id=/Vicksburg,_mississippi>Vicksburg</db> and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.
General McClellan.
After the Union defeat at the <db id=/First_battle_of_bull_run>First Battle of Bull Run</db> and the retirement of the aged <db id=/Winfield_scott>Winfield Scott</db> in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General <db id=/George_b._mcclellan>George B. McClellan</db> general-in-chief of all the Union armies. McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his <db id=/Peninsula_campaign>Peninsula Campaign</db>, longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the <db id=/Army_of_the_potomac>Army of the Potomac</db> by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops in defense of the capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.
Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief and appointed <db id=/Henry_wager_halleck>Henry Wager Halleck</db> in March 1862, after McClellan's "Harrison's Landing Letter", in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint <db id=/John_pope_(military_officer)>John Pope</db>, a Republican, as head of the new <db id=/Army_of_virginia>Army of Virginia</db>. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. However, lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the <db id=/Second_battle_of_bull_run>Second Battle of Bull Run</db> in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the <db id=/Css_virginia>CSS "Virginia"</db>, formerly the USS "Merrimack", damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the <db id=/Uss_monitor>USS "Monitor"</db>. Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the <db id=/Battle_of_hampton_roads>Battle of Hampton Roads</db>.
Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General <db id=/Robert_e._lee>Robert E. Lee</db>'s forces crossed the <db id=/Potomac_river>Potomac River</db> into Maryland, leading to the <db id=/Battle_of_antietam>Battle of Antietam</db> in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an <db id=/Emancipation_proclamation>Emancipation Proclamation</db> in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation. McClellan then resisted the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General <db id=/Don_carlos_buell>Don Carlos Buell</db> likewise refused orders to move the <db id=/Army_of_the_ohio>Army of the Ohio</db> against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with <db id=/William_rosecrans>William Rosecrans</db>; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican <db id=/Ambrose_burnside>Ambrose Burnside</db>. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.
Burnside, against the advice of the president, prematurely launched an offensive across the <db id=/Rappahannock_river>Rappahannock River</db> and was stunningly defeated by Lee at <db id=/Battle_of_fredericksburg>Fredericksburg</db> in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg. Lincoln brought in <db id=/Joseph_hooker>Joseph Hooker</db>, despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.
The <db id=/United_states_house_of_representatives_elections,_1862>mid-term elections</db> in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of "habeas corpus," <db id=/Conscription>the military draft law</db>, and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest. While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states, except New York. The Cincinnati "Gazette" contended that the voters were "depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress".
In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans' on Chattanooga, Grant's on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.
Hooker was routed by Lee at the <db id=/Battle_of_chancellorsville>Battle of Chancellorsville</db> in May, but continued to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to do the same in <db id=/Harper's_ferry>Harper's Ferry</db>, and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by <db id=/George_meade>George Meade</db>, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the <db id=/Gettysburg_campaign>Gettysburg Campaign</db>, which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.
After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.
Emancipation Proclamation.
Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At the beginning of the war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept <db id=/Compensated_emancipation>compensated emancipation</db> in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the <db id=/Founding_fathers_of_the_united_states>Founding Fathers</db>, under the constitution. President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General <db id=/John_c._frémont>John C. Frémont</db> in August 1861 and by Major General <db id=/David_hunter>David Hunter</db> in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.
On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. In July 1862, the Second <db id=/Confiscation_acts>Confiscation Act</db> was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action. In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it, he stated that "as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free."
Privately, Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated. However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor <db id=/Horace_greeley>Horace Greeley</db> of the highly influential "New York Tribune" fell for the ploy, and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22, 1862. The President said the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his "official duty") was preserving the Union:
The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states. Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.
Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper." For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up <db id=/Abraham_lincoln_on_slavery#colonization>colonies</db> for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the <db id=/War_governors'_conference>War Governors' Conference</db>; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.
Using former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. By the spring of 1863, he was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to <db id=/Andrew_johnson>Andrew Johnson</db>, the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, "The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once". By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General <db id=/Lorenzo_thomas>Lorenzo Thomas</db> had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley. <db id=/Frederick_douglass>Frederick Douglass</db> once observed of Lincoln: "In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color".
Gettysburg Address.
With the great Union victory at the <db id=/Battle_of_gettysburg>Battle of Gettysburg</db> in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the <db id=/New_york_city_draft_riots>New York City draft riots</db>. The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery. Defying Lincoln's prediction that "the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here," the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.
The Gettysburg Address was delivered at the dedication of the <db id=/Gettysburg_national_cemetery>Soldiers' National Cemetery</db> in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on the afternoon of Thursday, November 19, 1863. In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal." He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy would be assured, that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.
General Grant.
Meade's failure to capture Lee's army as it retreated from Gettysburg, and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed. General <db id=/Ulysses_s._grant>Ulysses S. Grant</db>'s victories at the <db id=/Battle_of_shiloh>Battle of Shiloh</db> and in the <db id=/Vicksburg_campaign>Vicksburg campaign</db> impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, "I can't spare this man. He fights." With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.
Nevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congress's consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General, which no officer had held since George Washington.
Grant waged his bloody <db id=/Overland_campaign>Overland Campaign</db> in 1864. This is often characterized as a <db id=/Attrition_warfare>war of attrition</db>, given high Union losses at battles such as the <db id=/Battle_of_the_wilderness>Battle of the Wilderness</db> and <db id=/Battle_of_cold_harbor>Cold Harbor</db>. Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had "almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces". The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, to which the general replied, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer."
The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army shrank with every costly battle. Grant's army moved south, crossed the <db id=/James_river>James River</db>, forcing a siege and trench warfare outside <db id=/Petersburg,_virginia>Petersburg, Virginia</db>. Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and <db id=/William_tecumseh_sherman>William Tecumseh Sherman</db> about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina. Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced his losses.
Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grant's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and <db id=/Philip_sheridan>Philip Sheridan</db> to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia's <db id=/Shenandoah_valley>Shenandoah Valley</db>. The damage caused by <db id=/Sherman's_march_to_the_sea>Sherman's March to the Sea</db> through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a swath, but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies. As Neely (2004) concludes, there was no effort to engage in "total war" against civilians, as in World War II.
Confederate general <db id=/Jubal_anderson_early>Jubal Anderson Early</db> began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital. During Early's <db id=/Battle_of_fort_stevens>raid on Washington, D.C.</db> in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain <db id=/Oliver_wendell_holmes,_jr.>Oliver Wendell Holmes</db> shouted at him, "Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!" After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.
As Grant continued to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President <db id=/Alexander_h._stephens>Stephens</db> led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at <db id=/Hampton_roads>Hampton Roads</db>. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the <db id=/Battle_of_five_forks>Battle of Five Forks</db> and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but <db id=/Freedmen>freedmen</db> greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at <db id=/Appomattox_court_house>Appomattox</db> and the war was effectively over.
1864 re-election.
Lincoln was a master politician, bringing together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party, and bringing in <db id=/War_democrats>War Democrats</db> such as <db id=/Edwin_m._stanton>Edwin M. Stanton</db> and <db id=/Andrew_johnson>Andrew Johnson</db> as well. Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket. At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected <db id=/Andrew_johnson>Andrew Johnson</db>, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new <db id=/National_union_party_(united_states)>Union Party</db>.
When Grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted, the lack of military success wore heavily on the President's re-election prospects, and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Sharing this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:
While the Democratic platform followed the "Peace wing" of the party and called the war a "failure", their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and <db id=/David_farragut>David Farragut</db>'s capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. By contrast, the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the <db id=/Perfidy>perfidy</db> of the Copperheads. Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide, carrying all but three states, and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers' vote.
On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his <db id=/Lincoln's_second_inaugural_address>second inaugural address</db>. In it, he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God's will. Historian <db id=/Mark_noll>Mark Noll</db> concludes it ranks "among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world". Lincoln said:
Reconstruction.
Reconstruction began during the war, as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states, and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. Shortly after Lee's surrender, a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, and Lincoln replied, "Let 'em up easy." In keeping with that sentiment, Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep. <db id=/Thaddeus_stevens>Thaddeus Stevens</db>, Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. <db id=/Benjamin_wade>Benjamin Wade</db>, political allies of the president on other issues. Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. His <db id=/Ten_percent_plan>Amnesty Proclamation</db> of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.
As Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals <db id=/Andrew_johnson>Andrew Johnson</db> and <db id=/Frederick_steele>Frederick Steele</db> as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General <db id=/Nathaniel_p._banks>Nathaniel P. Banks</db> to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the <db id=/Wade-davis_bill>Wade-Davis Bill</db>, in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.
Lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the choice of the Radicals, <db id=/Salmon_p._chase>Salmon P. Chase</db>, who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.
After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, which did not apply to every state, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment. Lincoln declared that such an amendment would "clinch the whole matter". By December 1863 a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery absolutely was brought to Congress for passage. This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives. Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864. After a long debate in the House, a second attempt passed Congress on January 31, 1865, and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification. Upon ratification, it became the <db id=/Thirteenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution>Thirteenth Amendment</db> to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865.
As the war drew to a close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of <db id=/Freedmen>freedmen</db>. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's <db id=/Freedman's_bureau>Freedman's Bureau</db> bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.
Redefining the republic and republicanism.
The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. The term "the United States" has historically been used, sometimes in the plural ("these United States"), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.
In recent years, historians such as Harry Jaffa, Herman Belz, John Diggins, Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln's redefinition of <db id=/Republicanism_in_the_united_states>republican values</db>. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the "sheet anchor" of republicanism. The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, "Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself." His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms. Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.
In March 1861, in his <db id=/Lincoln's_first_inaugural_address>First Inaugural Address</db>, Lincoln explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system. He said "A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people."
Other enactments.
Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. He signed the <db id=/Homestead_act>Homestead Act</db> in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The <db id=/Morrill_land-grant_colleges_act>Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act</db>, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The <db id=/Pacific_railway_acts>Pacific Railway Acts</db> of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' <db id=/First_transcontinental_railroad>First Transcontinental Railroad</db>, which was completed in 1869. The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.
Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a new Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third <db id=/Morrill_tariff>Morrill Tariff</db>, the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the <db id=/Revenue_act_of_1861>Revenue Act of 1861</db>, creating the first U.S. income tax. This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the <db id=/Revenue_act_of_1862>Revenue Act of 1862</db> to a progressive rate structure.
Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas. The creation of the system of national banks by the <db id=/National_banking_act>National Banking Act</db> provided a strong financial network in the country. It also established a national currency. In 1862, Congress created, with Lincoln's approval, the <db id=/United_states_department_of_agriculture>Department of Agriculture</db>. In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the "<db id=/Dakota_war_of_1862>Sioux Uprising</db>" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted <db id=/Sioux#santee_(isáŋyathi_or_eastern_dakota)>Santee Dakota</db> who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved). President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy.
In the wake of Grant's casualties in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, but it was never issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the "<db id=/New_york_world>New York World</db>" and the "<db id=/The_journal_of_commerce>Journal of Commerce</db>" published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.
Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the <db id=/Thanksgiving_(united_states)>Thanksgiving holiday</db> in the United States. Before Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation had been during <db id=/James_madison>James Madison</db>'s presidency 50 years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving. In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as <db id=/Yosemite_national_park>Yosemite National Park</db>.
Judicial appointments.
Supreme Court appointments.
Lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that "we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known." Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court. <db id=/Noah_haynes_swayne>Noah Haynes Swayne</db>, nominated January 21, 1862 and appointed January 24, 1862, was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. <db id=/Samuel_freeman_miller>Samuel Freeman Miller</db>, nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. <db id=/David_davis_(supreme_court_justice)>David Davis</db>, Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862 and appointed December 8, 1862, had also served as a judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit. <db id=/Stephen_johnson_field>Stephen Johnson Field</db>, a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863 and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, <db id=/Salmon_p._chase>Salmon P. Chase</db>, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.
Other judicial appointments.
Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges, including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the <db id=/Supreme_court_of_the_united_states>Supreme Court of the United States</db>, and 27 judges to the <db id=/United_states_district_courts>United States district courts</db>. Lincoln appointed no judges to the <db id=/United_states_circuit_court>United States circuit courts</db> during his time in office.
States admitted to the Union.
<db id=/West_virginia>West Virginia</db>, admitted to the Union June 20, 1863, contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union. As a condition for its admission, West Virginia's constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery. <db id=/Nevada>Nevada</db>, which became the third State in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on October 31, 1864.
Assassination.
<db id=/John_wilkes_booth>John Wilkes Booth</db> was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president. Learning that the President, First Lady, and head Union general Ulysses S. Grant would be attending <db id=/Ford's_theatre>Ford's Theatre</db>, Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President <db id=/Andrew_johnson>Andrew Johnson</db>, Secretary of State <db id=/William_h._seward>William H. Seward</db> and General Grant. Without his main bodyguard, <db id=/Ward_hill_lamon>Ward Hill Lamon</db>, Lincoln left to attend the play "<db id=/Our_american_cousin>Our American Cousin</db>" on April 14. Grant along with his wife chose at the last minute to travel to Philadelphia instead of attending the play.
Lincoln's bodyguard, John Parker, left Ford's Theater during intermission to join Lincoln's coachman for drinks in the Star Saloon next door. The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony. Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, aimed at the back of Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President. Major <db id=/Henry_rathbone>Henry Rathbone</db> momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.
After being on the run for 10 days, Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia, some south of Washington, D.C. After a brief fight with Union troops, Booth was killed by Sergeant <db id=/Boston_corbett>Boston Corbett</db> on April 26.
An Army surgeon, Doctor <db id=/Charles_leale>Charles Leale</db>, was sitting nearby at the theater and immediately assisted the President. He found the President unresponsive, barely breathing and with no detectable pulse. Having determined that the President had been shot in the head, and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought, he made an attempt to clear the blood clot, after which the President began to breathe more naturally. The dying man was taken across the street to <db id=/Petersen_house>Petersen House</db>. After being in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. Presbyterian minister <db id=/Phineas_densmore_gurley>Phineas Densmore Gurley</db>, then present, was asked to offer a prayer, after which Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages."
Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death. The late President lay in state in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. For his final journey with his son Willie, both caskets were transported in the executive coach "United States" and for three weeks the "Lincoln Special" <db id=/Funeral_and_burial_of_abraham_lincoln#funeral_train>funeral train</db> decorated in black bunting bore Lincoln's remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois stopping at many cities across the North for large-scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands, as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands, bonfires and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by.
Religious and philosophical beliefs.
As a young man, Lincoln was clearly a <db id=/Religious_skepticism>religious skeptic</db>, or, in the words of a biographer, even an <db id=/Iconoclasm>iconoclast</db>. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly <db id=/Evangelicalism>evangelical</db> Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife, but he was deeply familiar with the <db id=/Bible>Bible</db>, quoted it and praised it.
In the 1840s Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity, a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power. In the 1850s, Lincoln acknowledged "providence" in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence. When he suffered the death of his son Edward, Lincoln more frequently acknowledged his own need to depend on God. The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace. After Willie's death, Lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary. He wrote at this time that God "could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds." On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife Mary at <db id=/Ford's_theatre>Ford's Theatre</db> he desired to visit the <db id=/Holy_land>Holy Land</db>.
Historical reputation.
In <db id=/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_united_states>surveys of scholars ranking Presidents</db> since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often #1. A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after Washington. Of all the presidential ranking polls conducted since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls: Schlesinger 1948, Schlesinger 1962, 1982 Murray Blessing Survey, "Chicago Tribune" 1982 poll, Schlesinger 1996, CSPAN 1996, Ridings-McIver 1996, "Time" 2008, and CSPAN 2009. Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1) Lincoln; 2) George Washington; and 3) Franklin D. Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, occasionally are reversed.
President Lincoln's assassination made him a national martyr and endowed him with a recognition of mythic proportion. Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.
Schwartz argues that Lincoln's reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the <db id=/Progressive_era>Progressive Era</db> (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the Mall in Washington. In the <db id=/New_deal>New Deal</db> era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state. In the <db id=/Cold_war>Cold War</db> years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.
By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to <db id=/Conservatism_in_the_united_states>political conservatives</db> for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage, his acting in terms of <db id=/John_locke>Lockean</db> and <db id=/Edmund_burke>Burkean</db> principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers. As a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, internal improvements, and railroads in opposition to the <db id=/Jacksonian_democracy>agrarian Democrats</db>. William C. Harris found that Lincoln's "reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism.". James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation "in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform." Randall concludes that, "he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders."
By the late 1960s, liberals, such as historian <db id=/Lerone_bennett,_jr.>Lerone Bennett</db>, were having second thoughts, especially regarding Lincoln's views on racial issues. Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968. He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs, told jokes that ridiculed blacks, insisted he opposed social equality, and proposed <db id=/American_colonization_society>sending freed slaves</db> to another country. Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians; and that he was a "moral visionary" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible. The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation. Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered "erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule," in the late 20th century. On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of <db id=/Negative_capability>negative capability</db>, defined by the poet <db id=/John_keats>John Keats</db> and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were "content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason."
Memorials.
Lincoln appears on the penny and the $5 bill, and on many postage stamps. He has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names, including the <db id=/Lincoln,_nebraska>capital</db> of Nebraska.
The most famous and most visited memorials are the <db id=/Lincoln_memorial>Lincoln Memorial</db> in Washington, D.C.; Lincoln's sculpture on <db id=/Mount_rushmore>Mount Rushmore</db>; <db id=/Ford's_theatre>Ford's Theatre</db> and <db id=/Petersen_house>Petersen House</db> (where he died) in Washington and the <db id=/Abraham_lincoln_presidential_library_and_museum>Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum</db>, located in Springfield, Illinois, not far from <db id=/Lincoln's_tomb>Lincoln's Tomb</db>.
Barry Schwartz, a sociologist who has examined America's cultural memory, argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with "a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life." During the Great Depression, he argues, Lincoln served "as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful." Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, "What would Lincoln do?" However, he also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this "fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness." He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.

Aristotle

Aristotle ( , "Aristotélēs") (384 BC – 322 BC) was a <db id=/Greeks>Greek</db> <db id=/Philosophy>philosopher</db> and <db id=/Polymath>polymath</db>, a student of <db id=/Plato>Plato</db> and teacher of <db id=/Alexander_the_great>Alexander the Great</db>. His writings cover many subjects, including <db id=/Physics_(aristotle)>physics</db>, <db id=/Metaphysics>metaphysics</db>, <db id=/Poetics_(aristotle)>poetry</db>, <db id=/Theater>theater</db>, <db id=/Music>music</db>, <db id=/Logic>logic</db>, <db id=/Rhetoric>rhetoric</db>, <db id=/Linguistics>linguistics</db>, <db id=/Politics>politics</db>, <db id=/Government>government</db>, <db id=/Ethics>ethics</db>, <db id=/Biology>biology</db>, and <db id=/Zoology>zoology</db>. Together with <db id=/Plato>Plato</db> and <db id=/Socrates>Socrates</db> (Plato's teacher), Aristotle is one of the most important founding figures in Western philosophy. Aristotle's writings were the first to create a comprehensive system of <db id=/Western_philosophy>Western philosophy</db>, encompassing <db id=/Morality>morality</db>, <db id=/Aesthetics>aesthetics</db>, <db id=/Logic>logic</db>, <db id=/Science>science</db>, <db id=/Politics>politics</db>, and <db id=/Metaphysics>metaphysics</db>.
Aristotle's views on the <db id=/Aristotelian_physics>physical sciences</db> profoundly shaped medieval scholarship, and their influence extended well into the <db id=/Renaissance>Renaissance</db>, although they were ultimately replaced by <db id=/Classical_mechanics>Newtonian physics</db>. In the zoological sciences, some of his observations were confirmed to be accurate only in the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern <db id=/Formal_logic>formal logic</db>. 
In metaphysics, <db id=/Aristotelianism>Aristotelianism</db> had a profound influence on <db id=/Judeo-islamic_philosophies_(800_-_1400)>philosophical and theological thinking in the Islamic and Jewish traditions</db> in the <db id=/Middle_ages>Middle Ages</db>, and it continues to influence <db id=/Christian_theology>Christian theology</db>, especially the <db id=/Scholasticism>scholastic</db> tradition of the <db id=/Catholic_church>Catholic Church</db>. Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as المعلم الأول - "The First Teacher". 
His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of <db id=/Virtue_ethics>virtue ethics</db>. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues (<db id=/Cicero>Cicero</db> described his literary style as "a river of gold"), it is thought that the majority of his writings are now lost and only about one-third of the original works have survived.
Life.
Aristotle, whose name means "the best purpose," was born in <db id=/Stagira_(ancient_city)>Stagira</db>, <db id=/Chalcidice>Chalcidice</db>, in 384 BC, about east of modern-day <db id=/Thessaloniki>Thessaloniki</db>. His father <db id=/Nicomachus_(father_of_aristotle)>Nicomachus</db> was the personal physician to <db id=/Amyntas_iii_of_macedon>King Amyntas of Macedon</db>. Although there is little information on Aristotle' childhood, he probably did spend some time then in the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy. At about the age of eighteen, he went to <db id=/Athens>Athens</db> to continue his education at <db id=/Platonic_academy>Plato's Academy</db>. Aristotle remained at the academy for nearly twenty years before leaving Athens in 348/47 BC. The traditional story about his departure reports that he was disappointed with the direction the academy took after control passed to Plato's nephew <db id=/Speusippus>Speusippus</db> upon his death, although it is possible that he feared anti-Macedonian sentiments and left before Plato had died. He then traveled with <db id=/Xenocrates>Xenocrates</db> to the court of his friend <db id=/Hermias_of_atarneus>Hermias of Atarneus</db> in Asia Minor. While in Asia, Aristotle traveled with <db id=/Theophrastus>Theophrastus</db> to the island of <db id=/Lesbos>Lesbos</db>, where together they researched the <db id=/Botany>botany</db> and zoology of the island. Aristotle married Hermias's adoptive daughter (or niece) <db id=/Pythias>Pythias</db>. She bore him a daughter, whom they named Pythias. Soon after Hermias' death, Aristotle was invited by <db id=/Philip_ii_of_macedon>Philip II of Macedon</db> to become the tutor to his son <db id=/Alexander_the_great>Alexander</db> in 343 BC.
Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of <db id=/Macedon>Macedon</db>. During that time he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: <db id=/Ptolemy_i_soter>Ptolemy</db> and <db id=/Cassander>Cassander</db>. Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and his attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be "a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants".
By 335 BC he had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the <db id=/Lyceum_(classical)>Lyceum</db>. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with <db id=/Herpyllis>Herpyllis</db> of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, <db id=/Nicomachus_(son_of_aristotle)>Nicomachus</db>. According to the <db id=/Suda>Suda</db>, he also had an <db id=/Eromenos>eromenos</db>, <db id=/Palaephatus>Palaephatus of Abydus</db>.
It is during this period in Athens from 335 to 323 BC when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works. Aristotle wrote many dialogues, only fragments of which survived. The works that have survived are in <db id=/Treatise>treatise</db> form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication, as they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include "<db id=/Physics_(aristotle)>Physics</db>", "<db id=/Metaphysics_(aristotle)>Metaphysics</db>", "<db id=/Nicomachean_ethics>Nicomachean Ethics</db>", "<db id=/Politics_(aristotle)>Politics</db>", "<db id=/De_anima>De Anima</db> (On the Soul)" and "<db id=/Poetics_(aristotle)>Poetics</db>".
Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them. In physical science, Aristotle studied anatomy, astronomy, <db id=/Embryology>embryology</db>, geography, geology, meteorology, physics and zoology. In philosophy, he wrote on aesthetics, ethics, government, metaphysics, politics, economics, psychology, rhetoric and theology. He also studied education, foreign customs, literature and poetry. His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge. It has been suggested that Aristotle was probably the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time.
Near the end of Alexander's life, Alexander began to suspect plots against himself, and threatened Aristotle in letters. Aristotle had made no secret of his contempt for Alexander's pretense of divinity, and the king had executed Aristotle's grandnephew <db id=/Callisthenes>Callisthenes</db> as a traitor. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but there is little evidence for this.
Upon Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens once again flared. <db id=/Eurymedon_the_hierophant>Eurymedon the hierophant</db> denounced Aristotle for not holding the gods in honor. Aristotle fled the city to his mother's family estate in <db id=/Chalcis>Chalcis</db>, explaining, "I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy," a reference to Athens's prior <db id=/Trial_of_socrates>trial and execution of Socrates</db>. He died in Euboea of <db id=/Natural_causes>natural causes</db> within the year (in 322 BC). Aristotle named chief executor his student <db id=/Antipater>Antipater</db> and left a <db id=/Will_(law)>will</db> in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.
Thought.
Logic.
With the "<db id=/Prior_analytics>Prior Analytics</db>", Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic, and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th century advances in <db id=/Mathematical_logic>mathematical logic</db>. <db id=/Kant>Kant</db> stated in the "Critique of Pure Reason" that Aristotle's theory of logic completely accounted for the core of <db id=/Deductive_inference>deductive inference</db>.
History.
Aristotle "says that 'on the subject of reasoning' he 'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of'". However, Plato reports that <db id=/Syntax>syntax</db> was devised before him, by <db id=/Prodicus_of_ceos>Prodicus of Ceos</db>, who was concerned by the correct use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from <db id=/Dialectics>dialectics</db>; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like "<db id=/Reductio_ad_absurdum>reductio ad absurdum</db>" in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a <db id=/Deductive_system>deductive system</db>, he could never actually construct one and relied instead on his <db id=/Dialectic>dialectic</db>. Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from <db id=/Premise>premises</db>, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the <db id=/Logical_consequence>conclusion</db> would logically follow. Consequently, Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial. He never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book "<db id=/Sophist_(dialogue)>Sophist</db>", where he introduced his division method.
Analytics and the "Organon".
What we today call "Aristotelian logic", Aristotle himself would have labeled "analytics". The term "logic" he reserved to mean "dialectics". Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century AD:
The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the "Categories," the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in "On Interpretation", to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the "Analytics") and dialectics (in the "Topics" and "Sophistical Refutations"). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory "stricto sensu": the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the "Organon", namely the fourth book of "Metaphysics."
Aristotle's scientific method.
Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the <db id=/Universality_(philosophy)>universal</db>. Aristotle, however, finds the universal in <db id=/Particular>particular</db> things, which he calls the essence of things, while Plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their <db id=/Prototype>prototype</db> or <db id=/Exemplar>exemplar</db>. For Aristotle, therefore, philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal <db id=/Theory_of_forms>Forms</db> (or ideas) to a contemplation of particular imitations of these. For Aristotle, "form" still refers to the unconditional basis of <db id=/Phenomena>phenomena</db> but is "instantiated" in a particular substance (see "<db id=/Aristotle#universals_and_particulars>Universals and particulars</db>", below). In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both <db id=/Inductive_reasoning>inductive</db> and <db id=/Deductive_reasoning>deductive</db>, while Plato's is essentially deductive from "<db id=/A_priori_and_a_posteriori>a priori</db>" principles.
In Aristotle's terminology, "natural philosophy" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. In modern times, the scope of "philosophy" has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the <db id=/Scientific_method>scientific method</db>. In contrast, Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.
In the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as "science". Note, however, that his use of the term "science" carries a different meaning than that covered by the term "scientific method". For Aristotle, "all science ("dianoia") is either practical, poetical or theoretical" ("Metaphysics" 1025b25). By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, <db id=/Mathematics>mathematics</db> and metaphysics.
If logic (or "analytics") is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) <db id=/Logic>Logic</db>; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics and Mathematics; (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy.
In the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. He did, however, perform <db id=/Original_research>original research</db> in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences.
Aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. Beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.
His writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. For example, in his "<db id=/History_of_animals>History of Animals</db>" he claimed that human males have more teeth than females. In a similar vein, <db id=/John_philoponus>John Philoponus</db>, and later <db id=/Galileo_galilei>Galileo</db>, showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect. On the other hand, Aristotle refuted <db id=/Democritus>Democritus</db>'s claim that the <db id=/Milky_way>Milky Way</db> was made up of "those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays," pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given "current astronomical demonstrations" that "the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then ... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them."
In places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving 'laws of the universe' from simple observation and over-stretched <db id=/Reason>reason</db>. Today's scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws.
Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots. He posited a <db id=/Geocentrism>geocentric cosmology</db> that we may discern in selections of the "Metaphysics", which was widely accepted up until the 16th century. From the 3rd century to the 16th century, the dominant view held that the Earth was the rotational <db id=/History_of_the_center_of_the_universe>center of the universe</db>.
Since he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch. However, Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.
Geology.
As quoted from <db id=/W:charles_lyell>Charles Lyell's</db> "<db id=/Principles_of_geology>Principles of Geology</db>":
He refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages. He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized. He points to the growth of the Nilotic delta since the time of Homer, to the shallowing of the <db id=/Palus_maeotis>Palus Maeotis</db> within sixty years from his own time ... He alludes ... to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption. The changes of the earth, he says, are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives, that they are overlooked; and the migrations of people after great catastrophes, and their removal to other regions, cause the event to be forgotten.He says [12th chapter of his "Meteorics" 'the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time, but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land, and again it becomes land where it was sea, and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system, and within a certain period.' The concluding observation is as follows: 'As time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the Tanais, nor the Nile, can have flowed for ever. The places where they rise were once dry, and there is a limit to their operations, but there is none to time. So also of all other rivers; they spring up and they perish; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others The same tracts, therefore, of the earth are not some always sea, and others always continents, but every thing changes in the course of time.'
Physics.
Five elements.
Aristotle proposed a fifth element, aether, in addition to the four proposed earlier by <db id=/Empedocles>Empedocles</db>.
Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place. All that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe, i.e., the center of the Earth. Water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center. Air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere. Fire tends toward the lunar sphere (in which the Moon orbits). When elements are moved out of their natural place, they naturally move back towards it. This is "natural motion"—motion requiring no extrinsic cause. So, for example, in water, earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up; in air, rain falls and flame rises. Outside all the other spheres, the heavenly, fifth element, manifested in the stars and planets, moves in the perfection of circles.
Motion.
Aristotle defined <db id=/Motion_(physics)>motion</db> as the actuality of a potentiality "as such". Aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally; that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential, as a transition toward a potentially possible state. Because <db id=/Aristotle#substance,_potentiality_and_actuality>actuality and potentiality</db> are normally opposites in Aristotle, other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous, or that the addition of the "as such" to the definition is critical to understanding it.
Causality, The Four Causes.
Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active causal factors:
Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect). Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event (not necessarily a mental goal). Taking our two dominos, it requires someone to intentionally knock the dominos over as they cannot fall themselves.
Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.
Optics.
Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day. The earliest known written evidence of a <db id=/Camera_obscura>camera obscura</db> can be found in Aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350 BC in "Problemata". Aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or <db id=/Aperture>aperture</db>, to allow for sunlight to enter. Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object. In modern cameras, this is analogous to the <db id=/Diaphragm_(optics)>diaphragm</db>. Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased, the image was magnified.
Chance and spontaneity.
According to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of <db id=/Sumbebekos>accidental things</db>. It is "from what is spontaneous" (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of "chance" it might be better to think of "coincidence": Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place. For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.
There is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names "luck", that can only apply to human beings, since it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. "What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance".
Metaphysics.
Aristotle defines metaphysics as "the knowledge of <db id=/Hylomorphism>immaterial</db> being," or of "being in the highest degree of <db id=/Abstraction>abstraction</db>." He refers to metaphysics as "first philosophy", as well as "the theologic science."
Substance, potentiality and actuality.
Aristotle examines the concepts of <db id=/Substance_theory>substance</db> and <db id=/Essence>essence</db> ("ousia") in his "Metaphysics" (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form. In book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the <db id=/Material_substratum>substratum</db>, or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the "potential" house, while the form of the substance is the "actual" house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other <db id=/Genus-differentia_definition>differentia</db> (see also <db id=/Predicables>predicables</db>) that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.
With regard to the change ("<db id=/Potentiality_and_actuality>kinesis</db>") and its causes now, as he defines in his <db id=/Physics_(aristotle)>Physics</db> and <db id=/On_generation_and_corruption>On Generation and Corruption</db> 319b-320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:
The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality ("<db id=/Dunamis>dynamis</db>") and actuality ("<db id=/Entelecheia>entelecheia</db>") in association with the matter and the form.
Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially ("dynamei") plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' ("poiein") or 'be acted upon' ("paschein"), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate – being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise – acting).
Actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end ("telos") is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.
"For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see."
In summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a <db id=/Final_cause>final cause</db> or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality.
With this <db id=/Definition>definition</db> of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, "what is it that makes a man one"? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.
Universals and particulars.
Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.
Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but "good" is still a proper universal form. <db id=/Bertrand_russell>Bertrand Russell</db> is a contemporary philosopher who agreed with Plato on the existence of "uninstantiated universals".
Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.
In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.
Biology and medicine.
In Aristotelian science, most especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition. He dissected animals but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.
Empirical research program.
Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of <db id=/Lesbos>Lesbos</db>, and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. The works that reflect this research, such as "<db id=/History_of_animals>History of Animals</db>", "<db id=/Generation_of_animals>Generation of Animals</db>", and "<db id=/Parts_of_animals>Parts of Animals</db>", contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on <db id=/Catfish>catfish</db>, <db id=/Electric_ray>electric fish</db> ("<db id=/Torpedo_(genus)>Torpedo</db>") and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on <db id=/Cephalopod>cephalopods</db>, namely, "<db id=/Octopus>Octopus</db>", "Sepia" (<db id=/Cuttlefish>cuttlefish</db>) and the paper nautilus ("<db id=/Argonauta_argo>Argonauta argo</db>"). His description of the <db id=/Hectocotylus>hectocotyl arm</db> was about two thousand years ahead of its time, and widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē (<db id=/Selachians>selachians</db>).
Another good example of his methods comes from the "Generation of Animals" in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated.
He gave accurate descriptions of <db id=/Ruminant>ruminants</db>' four-chambered fore-stomachs, and of the <db id=/Ovoviviparity>ovoviviparous</db> embryological development of the <db id=/Hound_shark>hound shark</db> "<db id=/Mustelus_mustelus>Mustelus mustelus</db>".
Classification of living things.
Aristotle's classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the 19th century. What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood' (he was not to know that complex invertebrates do make use of <db id=/Hemoglobin>hemoglobin</db>, but of a different kind from vertebrates). Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (humans and mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs). In some respects, this incomplete classification is better than that of <db id=/Linnaeus>Linnaeus</db>, who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups, Insecta and Vermes (worms).
For <db id=/Charles_singer>Charles Singer</db>, "Nothing is more remarkable than efforts to [exhibit the relationships of living things as a "scala naturae"" Aristotle's "History of Animals" classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical "<db id=/Great_chain_of_being>Ladder of Life</db>" ("scala naturae"), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move.
Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e., <db id=/Final_cause>final causes</db>, guided all natural processes. Such a <db id=/Teleological>teleological</db> view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. Noting that "no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns," and "a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen," Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. Noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance.
In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the "scala naturae" or <db id=/Great_chain_of_being>Great Chain of Being</db>. His system had eleven grades, arranged according "to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality", expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs.
Aristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.
He placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.
Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain. Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of <db id=/Alcmaeon_of_croton>Alcmaeon</db>.
Successor: Theophrastus.
Aristotle's successor at the <db id=/Lyceum_(classical)>Lyceum</db>, <db id=/Theophrastus>Theophrastus</db>, wrote a series of books on botany—the "History of Plants"—which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the <db id=/Middle_ages>Middle Ages</db>. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as "carpos" for fruit, and "pericarpion" for seed vessel.
Rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's concept of the <db id=/Efficient_cause>efficient cause</db>. Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.
Influence on Hellenistic medicine.
After Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly. It is not until the age of <db id=/Alexandria>Alexandria</db> under the <db id=/Ptolemaic_dynasty>Ptolemies</db> that advances in biology can be again found.
The first medical teacher at Alexandria, <db id=/Herophilos>Herophilus of Chalcedon</db>, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between <db id=/Vein>veins</db> and <db id=/Artery>arteries</db>, noting that the latter <db id=/Pulse>pulse</db> while the former do not. Though a few ancient <db id=/Atomism>atomists</db> such as <db id=/Lucretius>Lucretius</db> challenged the <db id=/Teleology>teleological</db> viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, <db id=/Natural_theology>natural theology</db>) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. <db id=/Ernst_mayr>Ernst Mayr</db> claimed that there was "nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance." Aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.
Psychology.
Aristotle's <db id=/Psychology>psychology</db>, given in his treatise <db id=/On_the_soul>On the Soul</db> ("peri psyche", often known by its <db id=/Latin>Latin</db> title "De Anima"), posits three kinds of <db id=/Soul>soul</db> ("psyches"): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have a rational soul. This kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them.
For Aristotle, the soul ("psyche") was a simpler concept than it is for us today. By soul he simply meant the <db id=/Hylomorphism#body-soul_hylomorphism>form</db> of a living being. Since all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement).
Practical philosophy.
Ethics.
Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the "<db id=/Nicomachean_ethics>Nicomachean Ethics</db>".
Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ("ergon") of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the "<db id=/De_anima>psuchē</db>" (normally translated as "soul") in accordance with reason ("<db id=/Logos>logos</db>"). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, "<db id=/Eudaimonia>eudaimonia</db>", generally translated as "happiness" or sometimes "well being". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character ("ēthikē" "<db id=/Aretē>aretē</db>"), often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence).
Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom ("<db id=/Phronesis>phronesis</db>") and their intellect ("<db id=/Nous>nous</db>") can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished <db id=/Theory>theoretical</db> or speculative thinker, or in other words, a <db id=/Philosophy>philosopher</db>.
Politics.
In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled "<db id=/Politics_(aristotle)>Politics</db>". Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the <db id=/Family>family</db> which in turn is prior to the individual, "for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part". He also famously stated that "man is by nature a political animal." Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an <db id=/Organism>organism</db> rather than like a <db id=/Machine>machine</db>, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.
The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different to Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city ("<db id=/Polis>polis</db>") which functions as a political "community" or "partnership" ("koinōnia"). The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: "The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together." This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with <db id=/Social_contract>social contract</db> theory, according to which individuals leave the <db id=/State_of_nature>state of nature</db> because of "fear of violent death" or its "inconveniences."
Rhetoric and poetics.
Aristotle considered <db id=/Epic_poetry>epic poetry</db>, tragedy, comedy, <db id=/Dithyramb>dithyrambic poetry</db> and music to be <db id=/Mimesis>imitative</db>, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner. For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama. Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.
While it is believed that Aristotle's "Poetics" comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry. The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the <db id=/Catharsis>catharsis</db> of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes "Poetics" with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic <db id=/Mimesis>mimesis</db>. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.
Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the <db id=/Pythia>Delphic Oracle</db> and studied the fables of <db id=/Aesop>Aesop</db>.
Views on women.
Aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. On this ground, feminists have accused Aristotle of <db id=/Misogyny>misogyny</db> and <db id=/Sexism>sexism</db>. However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his "Rhetoric" that a society cannot be happy unless women are happy too.
Loss and preservation of his works.
Modern scholarship reveals that Aristotle's "lost" works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving Aristotelian corpus. Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication, the surviving works do not appear to have been so. Rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication. The authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally Aristotelian is also today held suspect, with some books duplicating or summarizing each other, the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely Aristotle's at all.
Some of the individual works within the corpus, including the "<db id=/Constitution_of_athens>Constitution of Athens</db>," are regarded by most scholars as products of Aristotle's "school," perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision. Others, such as "On Colors," may have been produced by Aristotle's successors at the Lyceum, e.g., <db id=/Theophrastus>Theophrastus</db> and <db id=/Strato_of_lampsacus>Straton</db>. Still others acquired Aristotle's name through similarities in doctrine or content, such as the "De Plantis," possibly by <db id=/Nicolaus_of_damascus>Nicolaus of Damascus</db>. Other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and <db id=/Astrological>astrological</db> and <db id=/Magical>magical</db> texts whose connections to Aristotle are purely fanciful and self-promotional.
According to a distinction that originates with Aristotle himself, his writings are divisible into two groups: the "<db id=/Exoteric>exoteric</db>" and the "<db id=/Esoteric>esoteric</db>". Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works intended for use within the school (esoteric). Modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be Aristotle's own (unpolished) lecture notes (or in some cases possible notes by his students). However, one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation. The 5th century <db id=/Neoplatonist>neoplatonist</db> <db id=/Ammonius_hermiae>Ammonius Hermiae</db> writes that Aristotle's writing style is deliberately <db id=/Obscurantism>obscurantist</db> so that "good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more, whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these."
Another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant – that all of Aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind. Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form. ("Fragments" of some of Aristotle's dialogues have survived.) Perhaps it is to these that <db id=/Cicero>Cicero</db> refers when he characterized Aristotle's writing style as "a river of gold"; it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us. However, some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that Cicero's praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works; a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in Aristotle's extant works.
One major question in the history of Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us? The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by <db id=/Strabo>Strabo</db> in his "Geography" and <db id=/Plutarch>Plutarch</db> in his "<db id=/Parallel_lives>Parallel Lives</db>". The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to <db id=/Neleus_of_scepsis>Neleus of Scepsis</db>. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to <db id=/Scepsis>Scepsis</db>, where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when <db id=/Apellicon_of_teos>Apellicon of Teos</db> discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When <db id=/Lucius_cornelius_sulla>Lucius Cornelius Sulla</db> occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to <db id=/Rome>Rome</db>, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian <db id=/Tyrannion_of_amisus>Tyrannion of Amisus</db> and then by the philosopher <db id=/Andronicus_of_rhodes>Andronicus of Rhodes</db>.
Carnes Lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides "the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B.C." Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however. First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon's inexpert attempt at repair. Second, there is "incontrovertible evidence," Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis. Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle's texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his. And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus' intervention list an Aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess. Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelian interpolations in the "<db id=/Politics_(aristotle)>Politics</db>", for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.
On the one hand, the surviving texts of Aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts, but rather from working drafts used within Aristotle's school, as opposed, on the other hand, to the <db id=/Corpus_aristotelicum#fragments>dialogues and other "exoteric" texts</db> which Aristotle published more widely during his lifetime. The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.
Legacy.
More than twenty-three hundred years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher <db id=/Bryan_magee>Bryan Magee</db>, "it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did". Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of <db id=/Formal_logic>formal logic</db>, pioneered the study of <db id=/Zoology>zoology</db>, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method. Despite these achievements, the influence of Aristotle's errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably. <db id=/Bertrand_russell>Bertrand Russell</db> notes that "almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine". Russell also refers to Aristotle's ethics as "repulsive", and calls his logic "as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy". Russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.
Later Greek philosophers.
The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the <db id=/Peripatetic_school>Peripatetic school</db>. Aristotle's notable students included <db id=/Aristoxenus>Aristoxenus</db>, <db id=/Dicaearchus>Dicaearchus</db>, <db id=/Demetrius_of_phalerum>Demetrius of Phalerum</db>, <db id=/Eudemos_of_rhodes>Eudemos of Rhodes</db>, <db id=/Harpalus>Harpalus</db>, <db id=/Hephaestion>Hephaestion</db>, <db id=/Meno>Meno</db>, <db id=/Mnason_of_phocis>Mnason of Phocis</db>, <db id=/Nicomachus_(son_of_aristotle)>Nicomachus</db>, and <db id=/Theophrastus>Theophrastus</db>. Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained "Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?"
Influence on Byzantine scholars.
Greek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus. The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were <db id=/John_philoponus>John Philoponus</db>, Elias, and David in the sixth century, and <db id=/Stephen_of_alexandria>Stephen of Alexandria</db> in the early seventh century. <db id=/John_philoponus>John Philoponus</db> stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle's views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought. After a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and <db id=/Michael_of_ephesus>Michael of Ephesus</db> reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by <db id=/Anna_comnena>Anna Comnena</db>.
Influence on Islamic theologians.
Aristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early <db id=/Islamic_theology>Islamic theology</db>. Most of the still extant works of Aristotle, as well as a number of the original <db id=/Greece>Greek</db> commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by <db id=/Muslim>Muslim</db> philosophers, scientists and scholars. <db id=/Averroes>Averroes</db>, <db id=/Avicenna>Avicenna</db> and <db id=/Alpharabius>Alpharabius</db>, who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced <db id=/Thomas_aquinas>Thomas Aquinas</db> and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers. <db id=/Alkindus>Alkindus</db> considered Aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the "exemplar" for all future philosophers. Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the "First Teacher". The title "teacher" was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars, and was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of Dante) who were influenced by the tradition of <db id=/Islamic_philosophy>Islamic philosophy</db>.
In accordance with the <db id=/Greeks>Greek</db> theorists, the Muslims considered Aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher, the author of a closed system, and believed that Aristotle shared with <db id=/Plato>Plato</db> essential tenets of thought. Some went so far as to credit Aristotle himself with neo-Platonic metaphysical ideas.
Influence on Western Christian theologians.
With the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c. AD 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the "Organon" made by <db id=/Boethius>Boethius</db>. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by <db id=/Gerard_of_cremona>Gerard of Cremona</db>, and from the original Greek, such as those by <db id=/James_of_venice>James of Venice</db> and <db id=/William_of_moerbeke>William of Moerbeke</db>. After <db id=/Thomas_aquinas>Thomas Aquinas</db> wrote his <db id=/Theology>theology</db>, working from Moerbeke's translations, the demand for Aristotle's writings grew and the <db id=/Greek_language>Greek</db> manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in <db id=/Europe>Europe</db> that continued into the <db id=/Renaissance>Renaissance</db>.
Aristotle is referred to as "The Philosopher" by <db id=/Scholasticism>Scholastic</db> thinkers such as <db id=/Thomas_aquinas>Thomas Aquinas</db>. See "<db id=/Summa_theologica>Summa Theologica</db>", Part I, Question 3, etc. These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods. The medieval English poet <db id=/Geoffrey_chaucer>Chaucer</db> describes his student as being happy by having
The Italian poet <db id=/Dante_alighieri>Dante</db> says of Aristotle in <db id=/The_divine_comedy>the first circles of hell</db>,
Post-Enlightenment thinkers.
The German philosopher <db id=/Friedrich_nietzsche>Friedrich Nietzsche</db> has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle. However implausible this is, it is certainly the case that Aristotle's rigid separation of action from production, and his justification of the subservience of slaves and others to the virtue – or "arete" – of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy. It is <db id=/Martin_heidegger>Martin Heidegger</db>, not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition. <db id=/Ayn_rand>Ayn Rand</db> accredited Aristotle as "the greatest philosopher in history" and cited him as a major influence on her thinking. More recently, <db id=/Alasdair_macintyre>Alasdair MacIntyre</db> has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.
List of works.
The works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school. Reference to them is made according to the organization of <db id=/Immanuel_bekker>Immanuel Bekker</db>'s Royal Prussian Academy edition ("Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica", Berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.

An American in Paris

An American in Paris is a <db id=/Symphony>symphonic</db> <db id=/Tone_poem>tone poem</db> by the American composer <db id=/George_gershwin>George Gershwin</db>, written in 1928. Inspired by the time Gershwin had spent in <db id=/Paris>Paris</db>, it evokes the sights and energy of the <db id=/France>French</db> capital in the 1920s. It is one of Gershwin's best-known compositions.
Gershwin composed "An American in Paris" on commission from the <db id=/New_york_philharmonic>New York Philharmonic</db>. He scored the piece for the standard instruments of the <db id=/Symphony_orchestra>symphony orchestra</db> plus <db id=/Celesta>celesta</db>, <db id=/Saxophone>saxophones</db>, and automobile horns. He brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the <db id=/New_york_city>New York</db> premiere of the composition, which took place on December 13, 1928 in <db id=/Carnegie_hall>Carnegie Hall</db>, with <db id=/Walter_damrosch>Walter Damrosch</db> conducting the <db id=/New_york_symphony>New York Symphony</db>. Gershwin completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the work's premiere.
Gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer <db id=/Deems_taylor>Deems Taylor</db>, noting that: "My purpose here is to portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere." When the tone poem moves into the <db id=/Blues>blues</db>, "our American friend ... has succumbed to a spasm of homesickness." But, "nostalgia is not a fatal disease." The American visitor "once again is an alert spectator of Parisian life" and "the street noises and French atmosphere are triumphant."
Background.
<db id=/Maurice_ravel>Maurice Ravel</db> met Gershwin in New York during Ravel's tour of the United States. In that meeting, Gershwin asked Ravel to be his teacher, to which Ravel responded that it was better to be a first-rate Gershwin than a second-rate Ravel. Instead, Ravel recommended that Gershwin see <db id=/Nadia_boulanger>Nadia Boulanger</db> in Paris. Ravel's high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to Boulanger caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking time to study abroad in Paris. 
Gershwin arrived in Paris in March 1928. Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers: among them <db id=/Ezra_pound>Ezra Pound</db>, <db id=/W._b._yeats>W. B. Yeats</db>, <db id=/Ernest_hemingway>Ernest Hemingway</db>; and artist <db id=/Pablo_picasso>Pablo Picasso</db>. Gershwin met with Boulanger and at her request he played ten minutes of his music. Boulanger replied that she had nothing to teach him. This did not set Gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his "<db id=/Rhapsody_in_blue>Rhapsody in Blue</db>".
Composition.
Gershwin based "An American in Paris" on a melodic fragment called "Very Parisienne", written in 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts, Robert and Mabel Schirmer. He described the piece as a "rhapsodic ballet" because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works. Gershwin explained in "<db id=/Musical_america>Musical America</db>", "My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere."
The piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose <db id=/Ternary_form>ABA format</db>. Gershwin's first A episode introduces the two main "walking" themes in the "Allegretto grazioso" and develops a third theme in the "Subito con brio". The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers <db id=/Claude_debussy>Claude Debussy</db> and <db id=/Les_six>Les Six</db>. This A section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, English horn, and taxi horns. The B section's "Andante ma con ritmo deciso" introduces the American <db id=/Blues>Blues</db> and spasms of homesickness. The "Allegro" that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster <db id=/Twelve-bar_blues>twelve-bar blues</db>. In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum. "Moderato con grazia" is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A. After recapitulating the "walking" themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final “Grandioso.”
Instrumentation.
"An American in Paris" is scored for 3 <db id=/Flute>flutes</db> (3rd doubling on <db id=/Piccolo>piccolo</db>), 2 <db id=/Oboe>oboes</db>, <db id=/English_horn>English horn</db>, 2 <db id=/Clarinet>clarinets</db> in B flat, <db id=/Bass_clarinet>bass clarinet</db> in B flat, 2 <db id=/Bassoon>bassoons</db>, 4 <db id=/Horn_(instrument)>horns</db> in F, 3 <db id=/Trumpet>trumpets</db> in B flat, 3 <db id=/Trombone>trombones</db>, <db id=/Tuba>tuba</db>, <db id=/Timpani>timpani</db>, <db id=/Snare_drum>snare drum</db>, <db id=/Bass_drum>bass drum</db>, triangle, wood block, <db id=/Cymbal>cymbals</db>, low and high <db id=/Tom-tom_drum>tom-toms</db>, <db id=/Xylophone>xylophone</db>, <db id=/Glockenspiel>glockenspiel</db>, <db id=/Celesta>celesta</db>, 4 <db id=/Vehicle_horn>taxi horns</db> resembling the pitches A, B, C and D, <db id=/Alto_saxophone>alto saxophone</db>/<db id=/Soprano_saxophone>soprano saxophone</db>, <db id=/Tenor_saxophone>tenor saxophone</db>/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, <db id=/Baritone_saxophone>baritone saxophone</db>/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, and <db id=/String_section>strings</db>.
The revised edition by F. Campbell-Watson calls for three saxophones, alto, tenor and baritone. In this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments.
<db id=/William_merrigan_daly>William Daly</db> arranged the score for piano solo which was published by New World Music in 1929.
Response.
Gershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of "An American in Paris". He stated that Damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with "a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses." Critics believed that "An American in Paris" was better crafted than his lukewarm <db id=/Concerto_in_f_(gershwin)>Concerto in F</db>. Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers <db id=/César_franck>César Franck</db>, <db id=/Richard_wagner>Richard Wagner</db>, or <db id=/Guillaume_lekeu>Guillaume Lekeu</db> on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics, "It's not a Beethoven Symphony, you know… It's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It's not intended to draw tears. If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds."
Recordings.
"An American in Paris" has been frequently recorded. The first recording was made for <db id=/Rca_victor>RCA Victor</db> in 1929 with <db id=/Nathaniel_shilkret>Nathaniel Shilkret</db> conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the <db id=/Philadelphia_orchestra>Philadelphia Orchestra</db>. Gershwin was on hand to "supervise" the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief <db id=/Celesta>celesta</db> solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. The radio broadcast of the September 8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which "An American in Paris," also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set. <db id=/Arthur_fiedler>Arthur Fiedler</db> and the <db id=/Boston_pops_orchestra>Boston Pops Orchestra</db> recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music. In 1945, <db id=/Arturo_toscanini>Arturo Toscanini</db> and the <db id=/Nbc_symphony_orchestra>NBC Symphony Orchestra</db> recorded the music in <db id=/Carnegie_hall>Carnegie Hall</db>, one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer. The Seattle Symphony also recorded a version in the 1980s of Gershwin's original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today.
Use in film.
In 1951, MGM released the musical "<db id=/An_american_in_paris_(film)>An American in Paris</db>", featuring <db id=/Gene_kelly>Gene Kelly</db> and <db id=/Leslie_caron>Leslie Caron</db>. Winning the 1951 Best Picture Oscar and numerous other awards, the film was directed by <db id=/Vincente_minnelli>Vincente Minnelli</db>, featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around the "An American in Paris" symphonic poem (arranged for the film by <db id=/Johnny_green>Johnny Green</db>), costing $500,000.
A part of the symphonic composition is also featured in "<db id=/As_good_as_it_gets>As Good as It Gets</db>", released in 1997.

The category's original name was Best Art Direction, but was changed to its current name in 2012 for the 85th Academy Awards, with the Art Director's branch being renamed the Designer's branch. The films below are listed with their production year, so the Oscar 2000 for best art direction went to a film from 1999. In the lists below, the winner of the award for each year is shown first, followed by the other nominees.

Academy Award

The Academy Awards, now officially known as The Oscars, are a set of awards given annually for excellence of cinematic achievements. The Oscar statuette is officially named the Academy Award of Merit and is one of nine types of Academy Awards. Organized and overseen by the <db id=/Academy_of_motion_picture_arts_and_sciences>Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</db> (AMPAS), the awards are given each year at a formal ceremony. The AMPAS was originally conceived by <db id=/Metro-goldwyn-mayer>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</db> studio executive <db id=/Louis_b._mayer>Louis B. Mayer</db> as a professional honorary organization to help improve the film industry’s image and help mediate labor disputes. The awards themselves were later initiated by the Academy as awards "of merit for distinctive achievement" in the industry.
The awards were first given in 1929 at a ceremony created for the awards, at the <db id=/Roosevelt_hotel_(hollywood)>Hotel Roosevelt</db> in <db id=/Hollywood>Hollywood</db>. Over the years that the award has been given, the categories presented have changed; currently Oscars are given in more than a dozen categories, and include films of various types. As one of the most prominent award ceremonies in the world, the Academy Awards ceremony is televised live in more than 100 countries annually. It is also the oldest award ceremony in the media; its equivalents, the <db id=/Grammy_awards>Grammy Awards</db> for music, the <db id=/Emmy_awards>Emmy Awards</db> for television, and the <db id=/Tony_awards>Tony Awards</db> for theater, are all modeled after the Academy Awards.
The <db id=/85th_academy_awards>85th Academy Awards</db> were held on Sunday, February 24, 2013, at the <db id=/Dolby_theatre>Dolby Theatre</db> in <db id=/Los_angeles>Los Angeles</db>, <db id=/California>California</db>. The <db id=/86th_academy_awards>86th Academy Awards</db> will be held on Sunday, March 2, 2014, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. This will be a week later than normal as not to interfere with the <db id=/2014_winter_olympics>2014 Winter Olympics</db>. 
History.
The first awards were presented on May 16, 1929, at a private brunch at the <db id=/Hollywood_roosevelt_hotel>Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel</db> with an audience of about 270 people. The post Academy Awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel. The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5. Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other personalities of the filmmaking industry of the time for their works during the 1927–1928 period.
Winners had been announced three months earlier; however, that was changed in the second ceremony of the Academy Awards in 1930. Since then and during the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11 pm on the night of the awards. This method was used until the "<db id=/Los_angeles_times>Los Angeles Times</db>" announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has since 1941 used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.
For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. For example, the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3, 1930, recognized films that were released between August 1, 1928 and July 31, 1929. Starting with the 7th Academy Awards, held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31.
The first Best Actor awarded was <db id=/Emil_jannings>Emil Jannings</db>, for his performances in "<db id=/The_last_command_(1928_film)>The Last Command</db>" and "<db id=/The_way_of_all_flesh_(film)>The Way of All Flesh</db>". He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. The honored professionals were awarded for all the work done in a certain category for the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period. Since the fourth ceremony, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. , a total of 2,809 Oscars have been given for 1,853 awards. A total of 302 actors have won Oscars in competitive acting categories or have been awarded Honorary or Juvenile Awards.
The 1939 film "<db id=/Beau_geste_(1939_film)>Beau Geste</db>" is the only movie that features as many as four Academy Award winners for Best Actor in a Leading Role (<db id=/Gary_cooper>Gary Cooper</db>, <db id=/Ray_milland>Ray Milland</db>, <db id=/Susan_hayward>Susan Hayward</db>, <db id=/Broderick_crawford>Broderick Crawford</db>) prior to any of the actors receiving the Best Actor Award.
At the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the <db id=/Best_foreign_language_film>Best Foreign Language Film</db> category was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films were honored with the Special Achievement Award.
Oscar statuette.
Design.
Although there are eight other types of annual awards presented by the Academy (the <db id=/Irving_g._thalberg_memorial_award>Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award</db>, the <db id=/Jean_hersholt_humanitarian_award>Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award</db>, the <db id=/Gordon_e._sawyer_award>Gordon E. Sawyer Award</db>, the <db id=/Academy_scientific_and_technical_award>Academy Scientific and Technical Award</db>, the <db id=/Academy_award_for_technical_achievement>Academy Award for Technical Achievement</db>, the <db id=/John_a._bonner_medal_of_commendation>John A. Bonner Medal of Commendation</db>, and the <db id=/Student_academy_award>Student Academy Award</db>) plus two awards that are not presented annually (the Special Achievement Award in the form of an Oscar statuette and the Honorary Award that may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette), the best known one is the "Academy Award of Merit" more popularly known as the Oscar <db id=/Statuette>statuette</db>. Made of gold-plated <db id=/Britannia_metal>britannium</db> on a black metal base, it is 13.5 in (34 cm) tall, weighs 8.5 lb (3.85 kg) and depicts a <db id=/Knight>knight</db> rendered in <db id=/Art_deco>Art Deco</db> style holding a <db id=/Crusade>crusader's</db> <db id=/Sword>sword</db> standing on a <db id=/Reel>reel</db> of film with five spokes. The five spokes each represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.
In 1928, <db id=/Mgm>MGM</db>'s art director <db id=/Cedric_gibbons>Cedric Gibbons</db>, one of the original Academy members, supervised the design of the award <db id=/Trophy>trophy</db> by printing the design on a scroll.
In need of a model for his statuette, Gibbons was introduced by his future wife <db id=/Dolores_del_río>Dolores del Río</db> to <db id=/Mexican_film_directors>Mexican film director</db> and actor <db id=/Emilio_fernández>Emilio "El Indio" Fernández</db>. Reluctant at first, Fernández was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the "Oscar". Then, sculptor <db id=/George_stanley_(sculptor)>George Stanley</db> (who also did the Muse Fountain at the <db id=/Hollywood_bowl>Hollywood Bowl</db>) sculpted Gibbons's design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 92.5 percent <db id=/Tin>tin</db> and 7.5 percent copper and then gold-plated it. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway & Sons Foundry in <db id=/Batavia,_illinois>Batavia, Illinois</db>, which also contributed to casting the molds for the <db id=/Vince_lombardi_trophy>Vince Lombardi Trophy</db> and <db id=/Emmy_award>Emmy Awards</db> statuettes. Since 1983, approximately 50 Oscars are made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer R.S. Owens & Company.
In support of the American effort in World War II, the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended.
Naming.
The origin of the name "Oscar" is disputed. One biography of <db id=/Bette_davis>Bette Davis</db> claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson; one of the earliest mentions in print of the term "Oscar" dates back to a <db id=/Time_(magazine)>"Time" magazine</db> article about the 1934 <db id=/6th_academy_awards>6th Academy Awards</db>. <db id=/Walt_disney>Walt Disney</db> is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932. Another claimed origin is that the Academy's Executive Secretary, <db id=/Margaret_herrick>Margaret Herrick</db>, first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette's reminding her of her "Uncle Oscar" (a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce). Columnist Sidney Skolsky was present during Herrick's naming and seized the name in his byline, "Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar'". The trophy was officially dubbed the "Oscar" in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. It may also have been named after the famous Irish playwright Oscar Wilde. In 1882, when disembarking in New York to begin his "Grand Tour" of America, Wilde was asked by a customs officer whether he had anything to declare and reputedly replied "I have nothing to declare but my genius."
Ownership of Oscar statuettes.
Since 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums. In December 2011, <db id=/Orson_welles>Orson Welles</db>' sole 1941 Oscar for "<db id=/Citizen_kane>Citizen Kane</db>" (<db id=/Best_original_screenplay>Best Original Screenplay</db>) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy.
While the Oscar is owned by the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market. <db id=/Mike_todd>Michael Todd</db>'s grandson tried to sell Todd's Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in 1989, but the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction. Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful, some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.
Nomination.
Since 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January. Prior to that, the results were announced in early February.
Voters.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 5,783 .
Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm <db id=/Pricewaterhousecoopers>PricewaterhouseCoopers</db> (and its predecessor <db id=/Price_waterhouse>Price Waterhouse</db>) for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies.
All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures.
New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.
In May 2011, the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting will be implemented in 2013.
Rules.
According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in <db id=/Los_angeles_county,_california>Los Angeles County, California</db>, to qualify (except for the Best Foreign Language Film). For example, the 2009 <db id=/Academy_award_for_best_picture>Best Picture</db> winner, "<db id=/The_hurt_locker>The Hurt Locker</db>", was actually first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the <db id=/81st_academy_awards>2008 awards</db> as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the <db id=/82nd_academy_awards>2009 awards</db>.
Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40 minutes, except for short subject awards, and it must exist either on a <db id=/35_mm_film>35 mm</db> or <db id=/70_mm_film>70 mm film</db> print or in 24 frame/s or 48 frame/s <db id=/Progressive_scan>progressive scan</db> <db id=/Digital_cinema>digital cinema</db> format with native resolution not less than <db id=/720p>1280x720</db>.
Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories. Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.
In late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6000 active members. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc.). There are some exceptions in the case of certain categories, like Foreign Film, Documentary and Animated Feature Film, in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches. In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category. Foreign films must include English subtitles, and each country can submit only one film per year.
The members of the various branches nominate those in their respective fields, while all members may submit nominees for Best Picture. The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories, including Best Picture.
Ceremony.
Telecast.
The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, most commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. <db id=/Black_tie>Black tie</db> dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a <db id=/Bow-tie>bow-tie</db>, and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast).
The Academy Awards is televised live across the United States (excluding <db id=/Hawaii>Hawaii</db>; they aired live in <db id=/Alaska>Alaska</db> starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996), Canada, the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world. The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans. Other awards ceremonies (such as the Emmys, Golden Globes, and <db id=/Grammy_award>Grammys</db>) are broadcast live in the East Coast but are on <db id=/Broadcast_delay>tape delay</db> in the West Coast and might not air on the same day outside North America (if the awards are even televised). The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally, but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources.
The Awards show was first televised on <db id=/Nbc>NBC</db> in 1953. NBC continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the <db id=/American_broadcasting_company>ABC</db> Network took over, televising the festivities through 1970, after which NBC resumed the broadcasts. ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976; it is under contract to do so through the year 2020.
After more than 60 years of being held in late March or early April, the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense <db id=/For_your_consideration_(advertising)>lobbying and ad campaigns</db> associated with <db id=/Oscar_season>Oscar season</db> in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the <db id=/Ncaa_men's_division_i_basketball_championship>NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship</db>, which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February <db id=/Sweeps>sweeps</db> period. (Some years, the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the Winter Olympics.) Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most <db id=/Emmys>Emmys</db> in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations.
After many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00 pm Eastern/6:00 p.m Pacific, in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30 pm Eastern/5:30 pm Pacific. The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier. For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.
On March 30, 1981, the awards ceremony was postponed for one day after <db id=/Reagan_assassination_attempt>the shooting</db> of President <db id=/Ronald_reagan>Ronald Reagan</db> and others in <db id=/Washington,_d.c.>Washington, D.C.</db>
In 1993, an "In Memoriam" segment was introduced, honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members. This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names.
In 2010, the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners' acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds. This, according to organizer Bill Mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed "the single most hated thing on the show" – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion.
The Academy has also had recent discussions about moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season. But such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail). Also, a January ceremony may have to compete with <db id=/National_football_league>National Football League</db> playoff games.
Awards ceremonies.
The following is a listing of all Academy Awards ceremonies.
Historically, the "Oscarcast" has pulled in a bigger haul when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture trophy. More than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the <db id=/70th_academy_awards>70th Academy Awards</db> in 1998, the year of "<db id=/Titanic_(1997_film)>Titanic</db>", which generated close to US$600 million at the North American box office pre-Oscars. The <db id=/76th_academy_awards>76th Academy Awards</db> ceremony in which "" (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368 million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture drew 43.56 million viewers. The most watched ceremony based on <db id=/Nielsen_ratings>Nielsen ratings</db> to date, however, was the <db id=/42nd_academy_awards>42nd Academy Awards</db> (Best Picture "<db id=/Midnight_cowboy>Midnight Cowboy</db>") which drew a 43.4% household rating on April 7, 1970.
By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings. The <db id=/78th_academy_awards>78th Academy Awards</db> which awarded low-budgeted, independent film "<db id=/Crash_(2004_film)>Crash</db>" (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4 million) generated an audience of 38.64 million with a household rating of 22.91%. In 2008, the <db id=/80th_academy_awards>80th Academy Awards</db> telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards. The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independently financed film ("<db id=/No_country_for_old_men_(film)>No Country for Old Men</db>").
Venues.
In 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the <db id=/Roosevelt_hotel_(hollywood)>Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel</db>. From 1930–1943, the ceremony alternated between two venues: the <db id=/Ambassador_hotel_(los_angeles)>Ambassador Hotel</db> on <db id=/Wilshire_boulevard>Wilshire Boulevard</db> and the <db id=/Millennium_biltmore_hotel>Biltmore Hotel</db> in downtown Los Angeles.
<db id=/Grauman's_chinese_theater>Grauman's Chinese Theater</db> in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the <db id=/Shrine_auditorium>Shrine Auditorium</db> in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The <db id=/21st_academy_awards>21st Academy Awards</db> in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theater at what was the Academy's headquarters on <db id=/Melrose_avenue>Melrose Avenue</db> in Hollywood.
From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's <db id=/Pantages_theatre_(hollywood)>Pantages Theatre</db>. With the advent of television, the 1953–1957 awards took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York first at the NBC International Theatre (1953) and then at the NBC Century Theatre (1954–1957), after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles. The Oscars moved to the <db id=/Santa_monica_civic_auditorium>Santa Monica Civic Auditorium</db> in <db id=/Santa_monica,_california>Santa Monica, California</db> in 1961. By 1969, the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles, this time to the <db id=/Dorothy_chandler_pavilion>Dorothy Chandler Pavilion</db> at the <db id=/Los_angeles_music_center>Los Angeles County Music Center</db>.
In 2002, the <db id=/Hollywood_and_highland_center_(theatre)>Kodak Theatre</db> became the permanent home of the award ceremonies. However, due to <db id=/Eastman_kodak>Eastman Kodak</db>'s bankruptcy issues, this theatre was renamed the <db id=/Hollywood_and_highland_center_(theatre)>Hollywood and Highland Center</db> in the days preceding the February 26, 2012, awards ceremony. As of May 2012, the theatre was once again renamed – to the <db id=/Dolby_theatre>Dolby Theatre</db> – after <db id=/Dolby_laboratories>Dolby Laboratories</db> acquired the naming rights.
Merit categories.
Current categories.
In the first year of the awards, the Best Director award was split into two separate categories (Drama and Comedy). At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories (Drama and Comedy/Musical). From the 1930s through the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two separate categories (black-and-white films and color films). Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup.
Another award, entitled the <db id=/Academy_award_for_best_original_musical>Academy Award for Best Original Musical</db>, is still in the Academy rulebooks and has yet to be discontinued. However, due to continuous insufficient eligibility each year, it has not been awarded since 1984 (when "<db id=/Purple_rain_(film)>Purple Rain</db>" won).
Proposed categories.
The Board of Governors meets each year and considers new award categories. To date, the following proposed categories have been rejected:
Special categories.
The Special Academy Awards are voted on by special committees, rather than by the Academy membership as a whole. They are not always presented on a consistent annual basis.
Criticism.
Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the "<db id=/Oscar_season>Oscar season</db>". This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality. <db id=/William_friedkin>William Friedkin</db>, an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as "the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself".
In addition, some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was <db id=/Dudley_nichols>Dudley Nichols</db> (Best Writing in 1935 for "<db id=/The_informer_(1935_film)>The Informer</db>"). Nichols boycotted the <db id=/8th_academy_awards>8th Academy Awards</db> ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers' Guild. <db id=/George_c._scott>George C. Scott</db> became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for "<db id=/Patton_(film)>Patton</db>") at the <db id=/43rd_academy_awards>43rd Academy Awards</db> ceremony. Scott described it as a 'meat parade', saying 'I don't want any part of it." The third winner, <db id=/Marlon_brando>Marlon Brando</db>, refused his award (Best Actor in 1972 for "<db id=/The_godfather>The Godfather</db>"), citing the film industry's discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans. At the <db id=/45th_academy_awards>45th Academy Awards</db> ceremony, Brando sent <db id=/Sacheen_littlefeather>Sacheen Littlefeather</db> to read a 15-page speech detailing his criticisms.
Tim Dirks, editor of <db id=/American_movie_classics>AMC's</db> <db id=/Filmsite.org>filmsite.org</db>, has written of the Academy Awards,
Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for sentimental reasons, personal popularity, atonement for past mistakes, or presented as a "career honor" to recognize a distinguished nominee's entire body of work.

International Atomic Time (TAI, from the <db id=/French_language>French</db> name Temps atomique international) is a high-precision atomic <db id=/Coordinate_time>coordinate</db> <db id=/Time_standard>time standard</db> based on the notional passage of <db id=/Proper_time>proper time</db> on <db id=/Earth>Earth</db>'s <db id=/Geoid>geoid</db>. It is the basis for <db id=/Coordinated_universal_time>Coordinated Universal Time</db> (UTC), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface, and for <db id=/Terrestrial_time>Terrestrial Time</db>, which is used for astronomical calculations. Since 30 June 2012 when the last leap second was added, TAI has been exactly 35 seconds ahead of UTC. The 35 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 25 <db id=/Leap_second>leap seconds</db> in UTC since 1972.
Time coordinates on the TAI scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both <db id=/Julian_date>Julian Dates</db> and the <db id=/Gregorian_calendar>Gregorian calendar</db> are used. TAI in this form was synchronised with <db id=/Universal_time>Universal Time</db> at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.
Operation.
TAI as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over 200 <db id=/Atomic_clock>atomic clocks</db> in over 50 national laboratories worldwide. The clocks are compared using <db id=/Gps>GPS</db> signals and <db id=/Two-way_satellite_time_and_frequency_transfer>two-way satellite time and frequency transfer</db>. Due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone (see <db id=/Signal_averaging>signal averaging</db> for a discussion). The majority of the clocks are <db id=/Caesium>caesium</db> clocks; the definition of the <db id=/Si>SI</db> second is written in terms of caesium.
The participating institutions each broadcast, in real time, a frequency signal with <db id=/Time_code>time codes</db>, which is their estimate of TAI. Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC, which differs from TAI by a well-known integer number of seconds. These time scales are denoted in the form "UTC(NPL)" in the UTC form, where "NPL" in this case identifies the <db id=/National_physical_laboratory,_uk>National Physical Laboratory, UK</db>. The TAI form may be denoted "TAI(NPL)". The latter is not to be confused with "TA(NPL)", which denotes an independent atomic time scale, not synchronised to TAI or to anything else.
The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other. The <db id=/International_bureau_of_weights_and_measures>International Bureau of Weights and Measures</db> (BIPM, France), combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible. This combined time scale is published monthly in Circular T, and is the <db id=/Canonical_form>canonical</db> TAI. This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC-UTC("k") (equivalent to TAI-TAI("k")) for each participating institution "k". (The same circular also gives tables of TAI-TA("k"), for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales.)
Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T. Aside from this, once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised. In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale. Doing so does not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of <db id=/Terrestrial_time>Terrestrial Time</db> (TT).
History.
Early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously. Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the <db id=/National_physical_laboratory_(united_kingdom)>National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL)</db>. The "Greenwich Atomic" (GA) scale began in 1955 at the <db id=/Royal_greenwich_observatory>Royal Greenwich Observatory</db>. The <db id=/International_time_bureau>International Time Bureau</db> (BIH) began a time scale, Tm or AM, in July 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of <db id=/Vlf>VLF</db> radio signals. The <db id=/United_states_naval_observatory>United States Naval Observatory</db> began the A.1 scale 13 September 1956, using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the National Bureau of Standards, <db id=/Boulder,_colorado>Boulder, Colorado</db>. Both the BIH scale and A.1 was defined by an <db id=/Epoch_(reference_date)>epoch</db> at the beginning of 1958: it was set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1 January 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding <db id=/Ut2>UT2</db> instant. The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: "A3" in 1963 and "TA(BIH)" in 1969. This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the <db id=/Astronomy>astronomical</db> realisation of UT2. At the time, UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second.
In 1961, UTC began. UTC is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time, the discontinuities being arranged so that UTC approximated <db id=/Ut2>UT2</db> until the end of 1971, and <db id=/Ut1>UT1</db> thereafter. This was a compromise arrangement for a broadcast time scale: a linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised, while approximating UT1 means that tasks such as <db id=/Navigation>navigation</db> which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts.
The SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967, and in 1971 it was renamed International Atomic Time (TAI).
In the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to <db id=/Gravitational_time_dilation>gravitational time dilation</db>, and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the <db id=/Altitude>altitudes</db> of the various clocks. Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at <db id=/Mean_sea_level>mean sea level</db> (the geoid). Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about 10−12. The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name "EAL" ("Echelle Atomique Libre", meaning "Free Atomic Scale").
The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for <db id=/Barycentric_coordinate_time>Barycentric Coordinate Time</db> (TCB), <db id=/Geocentric_coordinate_time>Geocentric Coordinate Time</db> (TCG), and <db id=/Terrestrial_time>Terrestrial Time</db> (TT). All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant. (The offset is to provide continuity with the older <db id=/Ephemeris_time>Ephemeris Time</db>.) TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184 s.
The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R which stated "In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC."

Altruism

Altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the <db id=/Quality_of_life>welfare</db> of others. It is a traditional <db id=/Virtue>virtue</db> in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions, though the concept of "others" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of <db id=/Selfishness>selfishness</db>.
Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of <db id=/Duty>duty</db> and <db id=/Loyalty>loyalty</db>. Altruism is a motivation to provide something of value to a party who must be anyone but one's self, while duty focuses on a <db id=/Moral_obligation>moral obligation</db> towards a specific individual (e.g., a <db id=/God>god</db>, a <db id=/Monarch>king</db>), or collective (e.g., a <db id=/Government>government</db>). Pure altruism consists of sacrificing something for someone other than the self (e.g. sacrificing time, energy or possessions) with no expectation of any compensation or benefits, either direct, or indirect (e.g., receiving recognition for the act of giving). 
Much debate exists as to whether ""true"" altruism is possible. The theory of <db id=/Psychological_egoism>psychological egoism</db> suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an <db id=/Intrinsic>intrinsic</db> reward in the form of personal <db id=/Gratification>gratification</db>. The validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as "benefits." 
The term "altruism" may also refer to an <db id=/Altruism_(ethics)>ethical doctrine</db> that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it's usually contrasted to <db id=/Ethical_egoism>egoism</db>, which is defined as acting to the benefit of one's self.
The notion of altruism.
The concept has a long history in <db id=/Philosophy>philosophical</db> and <db id=/Ethics>ethical</db> thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding <db id=/Sociologist>sociologist</db> and <db id=/Philosopher_of_science>philosopher of science</db>, <db id=/Auguste_comte>Auguste Comte</db>, and has become a major topic for <db id=/Psychologists>psychologists</db> (especially <db id=/Evolutionary_psychology>evolutionary psychology</db> researchers), <db id=/Evolutionary_biologists>evolutionary biologists</db>, and <db id=/Ethology>ethologists</db>. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.
Scientific viewpoints.
Anthropology.
<db id=/Marcel_mauss>Marcel Mauss</db>'s book "The Gift" contains a passage: "Note on alms." This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice. In it, he writes:
Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand,
and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other. Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis
avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth
of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the
gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits accept that
the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been
hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.
Evolutionary explanations.
In the science of <db id=/Ethology>ethology</db> (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of <db id=/Social_evolution>social evolution</db>, altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the <db id=/Fitness_(biology)>fitness</db> of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor. In <db id=/Evolutionary_psychology>evolutionary psychology</db> this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, <db id=/Tipping>tipping</db>, courtship gifts, production of <db id=/Public_good>public goods</db>, and <db id=/Environmentalism>environmentalism</db>. 
Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins. Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from <db id=/Game_theory>game theory</db>.
Some of the proposed mechanisms are:
Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their <db id=/Inclusive_fitness>inclusive fitness</db> when they are doing altruistic acts. Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote altruistic behaviors.
Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment. This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.
The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups. Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors, and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup. 
The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind <db id=/George_r._price>George R. Price</db>'s development of the <db id=/Price_equation>Price equation</db>, which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular <db id=/Slime_mould>slime moulds</db>, such as "<db id=/Dictyostelid>Dictyostelium</db> mucoroides." These protists live as individual <db id=/Amoebae>amoebae</db> until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.
Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.
Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist <db id=/Peter_kropotkin>Peter Kropotkin</db> in his 1902 book "" and <db id=/Peter_singer>Peter Singer</db> in his book "<db id=/A_darwinian_left>A Darwinian Left</db>."
Most recently, <db id=/Jeremy_griffith>Jeremy Griffith</db> has proposed a biological theory for the development of truly altruistic instincts that accommodates the biological imperative to reproduce, as evidenced by a moral conscience visible in humans today.
Neurobiology.
Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the <db id=/National_institutes_of_health>National Institutes of Health</db> and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using <db id=/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging>functional magnetic resonance imaging</db>. In their research, published in the <db id=/Proceedings_of_the_national_academy_of_sciences>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</db> USA in October, 2006, they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the <db id=/Mesolimbic_pathway>mesolimbic</db> reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.
Another experiment funded by the <db id=/National_institutes_of_health>National Institutes of Health</db> and conducted in 2007 at the <db id=/Duke_university>Duke University</db> in <db id=/Durham,_north_carolina>Durham</db>, North Carolina suggests a different view, "that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it." In the study published in the February 2007 print issue of <db id=/Nature_neuroscience>Nature Neuroscience</db>, researchers have found a part of the brain that behaves differently for altruistic and selfish people.
The researchers invited 45 volunteers to play a computer game and also to watch the computer play the game. In some rounds, the game resulted in the volunteers winning money for themselves, and in others it resulted in money being donated to a charity of the volunteer's choice. During these activities, the researchers took functional magnetic resonance imaging (<db id=/Fmri>fMRI</db>) scans of the participants' brains and were "surprised by the results". Although they "were expecting to see activity in the brain's reward centers," based on the idea that "people perform altruistic acts because they feel good about it," what they found was that "another part of the brain was also involved, and it was quite sensitive to the difference between doing something for personal gain and doing it for someone else's gain." That part of the brain is called the posterior superior <db id=/Temporal_cortex>temporal cortex</db> (pSTC).
In the next stage, the scientists asked the participants some questions about type and frequency of their altruistic or helping behaviours. They then analysed the responses to generate an estimate of a person's tendency to act altruistically and compared each person's level of altruism against their <db id=/Fmri>fMRI</db> <db id=/Brain_scan>brain scan</db>. The results showed that pSTC activity rose in proportion to a person's self-reported level of altruism. According to the researchers, the results suggest that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it. "We believe that the ability to perceive other people's actions as meaningful is critical for altruism," said lead study investigator Dharol Tankersley.
Psychology.
The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines "psychological altruism" as "a motivational state with the goal of increasing another’s welfare." Psychological altruism is contrasted with "psychological egoism," which refers to the motivation to increase one’s own welfare.
There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism. Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors. However, because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question. The <db id=/Social_exchange_theory>social exchange theory</db> postulates that altruism only exists when benefits outweigh costs. <db id=/Daniel_batson>Daniel Batson</db> is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory. He identified four major motives for altruism: altruism to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle (<db id=/Principlism>principlism</db>). Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless. The "<db id=/Empathy-altruism>empathy-altruism</db> hypothesis" basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering. Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions. People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another's suffering. Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues.
In psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service. Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the "<db id=/Bystander_effect>Bystander effect</db>"). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility. However, a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders.
Many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism (as a form of altruism) on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being. In a study of older adults, those who volunteered were significantly higher on life satisfaction and will to live, and significantly lower in <db id=/Depression_(mood)>depression</db>, <db id=/Anxiety>anxiety</db>, and <db id=/Somatization>somatization</db>. Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health, but physical health and longevity as well. One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52% of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one. A study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period, people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying. After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality. Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well-being. A study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness.
It is important to note that, while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness, it has also been found to work in the opposite direction—that happier people are also kinder. The relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional. Studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states. Studies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness. For example, one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one (although positive effects were still significant). Additionally, while generous acts make people feel good about themselves, it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others. Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being. A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that “a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals, positive affect, offering emotional support, sleep quality, and well-being.”
Sociology.
"Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity". American Sociological Association.). The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field. The American Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges <db id=/Public_sociology>Public sociology</db> saying, "The intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity" ASA). This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies. How altruism is framed, organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and "build the good society". 
Religious viewpoints.
Most, if not all, of the world's <db id=/Religion>religions</db> promote altruism as a very important moral value. <db id=/Buddhism>Buddhism</db>, <db id=/Christianity>Christianity</db>, <db id=/Hinduism>Hinduism</db>, <db id=/Islam>Islam</db>, <db id=/Jainism>Jainism</db>, <db id=/Judaism>Judaism</db> and <db id=/Sikhism>Sikhism</db>, etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.
Buddhism.
Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism. Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering. "Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion. These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being" (Dalai Lama).
Since "all beings" includes the individual, love and compassion in Buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other. It is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering. In practical terms, however, since most of us are spontaneously self-centered, Buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others, and thus can be characterized as "altruistic." Many would agree with the <db id=/Dalai_lama>Dalai Lama</db> that Buddhism as a religion is kindness toward others.
Still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: "The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes" (Dalai Lama).
In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what I cause: if I cause suffering, then as a natural consequence I will experience suffering; if I cause happiness, then as a natural consequence I will experience happiness.
In Buddhism, "karma" (Pāli "kamma") is strictly distinguished from <db id=/Vipaka>vipāka</db>, meaning "fruit" or "result". Karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause (Pāli "hetu") in the <db id=/Twelve_nidanas>chain</db> of <db id=/Pratitya-samutpada>cause and effect</db>, where it comprises the elements of "volitional activities" (Pali "sankhara") and "action" (Pali "bhava"). Any action is understood to create "seeds" in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results (Pāli "vipaka") when they meet the right conditions. Most types of karmas, with good or bad results, will keep one in the wheel of <db id=/Samsara_(buddhism)>samsāra</db>; others will liberate one to <db id=/Nirvana>nirvāna</db>.
Buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action. Motivation usually makes the difference between "good" and "bad", but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance; so a well-intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be "bad" in that it creates unpleasant results for the "actor."
In Buddhism, karma is not the only cause of all that happens. As taught in the early texts, the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories, known as Niyama Dhammas:
Jainism.
The fundamental principles of <db id=/Jainism>Jainism</db> revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches the view of <db id=/Ahimsa>Ahimsa</db> – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first Thirthankar, Rishabh introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.
Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. They are:
A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride (ego) by humility, deceit by straight-forwardness and greed by contentment.
The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become Siddha (Param-atma – "highest soul"). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders. The "great vows" (mahavrata) are prescribed for monks and "limited vows" (anuvrata) are prescribed for householders. In other words, the house-holders are encouraged to practice the five cardinal principles of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy and non-possessiveness with their current practical limitations while the monks have to observe them very strictly. With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.
Christianity.
Altruism is central to the teachings of <db id=/Jesus>Jesus</db> found in the <db id=/Gospel>Gospel</db>, especially in the <db id=/Sermon_on_the_mount>Sermon on the Mount</db> and the <db id=/Sermon_on_the_plain>Sermon on the Plain</db>. From biblical to medieval <db id=/Christian_traditions>Christian traditions</db>, tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of "disinterested love", as in the <db id=/Paul_the_apostle>Pauline</db> phrase "love seeks not its own interests." In his book "Indoctrination and Self-deception," Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.
<db id=/St_thomas_aquinas>St Thomas Aquinas</db> in the "<db id=/Summa_theologica>Summa Theologica</db>", II:II Quaestio 25, Article 4 states that we should love our neighbour more than our ourselves. His interpretation of the Pauline phrase is that we should seek the common good more than the private good, but this is because the common good is a more desirable good for the individual. St Thomas interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself' from <db id=/Leviticus>Leviticus</db> 19 and Matthew 22 as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, <db id=/Auguste_comte>Comte</db> was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within <db id=/Catholic_church>Catholicism</db>.
Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God. <db id=/Thomas_jay_oord>Thomas Jay Oord</db> has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.
German philosopher <db id=/Max_scheler>Max Scheler</db> distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak. One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, "motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one’s own life and existence". Another way is merely "one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people’s business." At its worst, Scheler says, "love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse."
Islam and Sufism.
In <db id=/Sufism>Sufism</db>, the concept 'īṯār' (altruism) is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself'. For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns. The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; <db id=/Islam>Islam</db> considers those practicing īṯār as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.
This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in i'thar attention is focused on everything in existence. A constant concern for <db id=/Allah>Allah</db> (i.e. <db id=/God>God</db>) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.
This concept was emphasized by Sufi mystics like <db id=/Rabia_al-adawiyya>Rabia al-Adawiyya</db> who paid attention to the difference between dedication to <db id=/Allah>Allah</db> (i.e. <db id=/God>God</db>) and dedication to people. Thirteenth-century Turkish sufi poet <db id=/Yunus_emre>Yunus Emre</db> explained this philosophy as "Yaratılanı severiz, Yaratandan ötürü" or "We love the creature, because of The Creator." For many Muslims, i'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays. However, i'thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times.
Judaism.
Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The famous Rabbi <db id=/Abraham_isaac_kook>Abraham Isaac Kook</db> stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity. This is defined as <db id=/Corporate_welfare>bestowal</db>, or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or <db id=/God>God</db>. <db id=/Kabbalah>Kabbalah</db> defines <db id=/God>God</db> as the force of giving in <db id=/Existence>existence</db>. Rabbi <db id=/Moshe_chaim_luzzatto>Moshe Chaim Luzzatto</db> in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of <db id=/God>God</db> was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.
Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi <db id=/Yehuda_ashlag>Yehuda Ashlag</db>, in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework. Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to <db id=/Divinity>divinity</db>.
Sikhism.
Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion. 
The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness.
The fifth Nanak, Guru Arjun Dev Sacrificed his life to uphold 22 Carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity, the Guru Granth. The Ninth Nanak, Guru Tegh Bahadur Sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity. In the late 17th century, <db id=/Guru_gobind_singh>Guru Gobind Singh</db> Ji (the tenth <db id=/Guru>guru</db> in Sikhism), was in war with the <db id=/Moghul>Moghul</db> rulers to protect the people of different faiths, when a fellow Sikh, <db id=/Bhai_kanhaiya>Bhai Kanhaiya</db>, attended the troops of the enemy. He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield.
"What were you doing, and why?" asked the Guru. "I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them," replied Bhai Kanhaiya.
The Guru responded, "Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru."
It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.
Hinduism.
<db id=/Advaita_vedanta>Advaita Vedanta</db> differs from the view that karma is a law of cause and effect but instead additionally hold that karma is mediated by the will of a personal supreme god. This view of karma is in contradiction to <db id=/Buddhism>Buddhism</db>, <db id=/Jainism>Jainism</db> and other <db id=/Indian_religions>Indian religions</db> that do view karma as a law of cause and effect.
<db id=/Swami_sivananda>Swami Sivananda</db>, an <db id=/Advaita>Advaita</db> scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the <db id=/Brahma_sutras>Brahma Sutras</db>, a Vedantic text. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates <db id=/Apurva>apurva</db> or <db id=/Merit_(buddhism)>punya</db>, which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.
Philosophy.
There exists a wide range of philosophical views on man's obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of <db id=/Altruism_(ethics)>ethical altruism</db> maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is <db id=/Ethical_egoism>ethical egoism</db>, which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with <db id=/Utilitarianism>utilitarianism</db>, which is the view that every individual's well-being (including one's own) is of equal moral importance.
A related concept in <db id=/Descriptive_ethics>descriptive ethics</db> is <db id=/Psychological_egoism>psychological egoism</db>, the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible. <db id=/Rational_egoism>Rational egoism</db> is the view that <db id=/Rationality>rationality</db> consists in acting in one's self-interest (without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations).
