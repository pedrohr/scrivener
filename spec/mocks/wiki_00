Anarchism

Anarchism is often defined as a <db id=/Political_philosophy>political philosophy</db> which holds the <db id=/State_(polity)>state</db> to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful. However, others argue that while anti-statism is central, it is inadequate to define anarchism. Therefore, they argue instead that anarchism entails opposing <db id=/Authority>authority</db> or <db id=/Hierarchical_organization>hierarchical organization</db> in the conduct of human relations, including, but not only, the state system. Proponents of anarchism, known as "anarchists", advocate <db id=/Stateless_society>stateless societies</db> based on non-<db id=/Hierarchy>hierarchical</db> <db id=/Free_association_(communism_and_anarchism)>free associations</db>.
As a subtle and anti-dogmatic philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy. Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive. <db id=/Anarchist_schools_of_thought>Anarchist schools of thought</db> can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme <db id=/Individualism>individualism</db> to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of <db id=/Social_anarchism>social</db> and <db id=/Individualist_anarchism>individualist anarchism</db> or similar dual classifications.
Anarchism as a mass <db id=/Social_movement>social movement</db> has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. The central tendency of anarchism as a social movement has been represented by <db id=/Anarchist_communism>anarcho-communism</db> and <db id=/Anarcho-syndicalism>anarcho-syndicalism</db>, with <db id=/Individualist_anarchism>individualist anarchism</db> being primarily a literary phenomenon which nevertheless did have an impact on the bigger currents and individualists have also participated in large anarchist organizations.
